1,Ep. 5 | Berkshire's choppy returns | The 9/11 impact on insurance business | The AGM Fest,"The period from 1997 to 2001 was a roller-coaster ride for Berkshire Hathaway or, rather, the stock markets globally. The dot-com bubble built up in the late 1990s and then burst in 2000. Berkshire did not see massive rallies or declines because it did not have any technology stocks. 

The US witnessed a major terrorist attack in 2001. As an insurance company, 9/11 was a big blow to Berkshire Hathaway. The impact was amplified because it had recently acquired General Re, a global reinsurance behemoth.

In this episode covering Warren Buffett’s letters from 1997 to 2001, we also discover some quirky facts about Berkshire Hathaway. For the amount of taxes it paid, Berkshire was shouldering more than half a day’s functioning of the US government. And the Berkshire HQ had only 13.8 employees. Wait, what?

9,"Ep. 4 | Buffett's views on stock splits, beta, diversfication | Stories of GEICO, American Express","A single Berkshire Hathaway share is bigger than most people's entire investment portfolios. Still, Berkshire shares have never been split. Money managers saw an opportunity in this—they started mutual funds that would pool money from smaller investors to clone Berkshire’s portfolio. Warren saw the risks faced by smaller investors in this and found an alternative to stock splits.

Warren Buffett has unconventional views in almost every aspect of investing. He dismissed the use of beta as a measure of risk, did not think he needed diversification to manage risk and called growth investing speculative.

In this episode, covering Buffett’s letters from 1992 to 1996, we travel back in time as we discuss two of his star investments: GEICO and American Express.

13,Why does the sequence of returns risk matter when there are periodic withdrawals I Ft Ravi Saraogi,"In this video, Ravi Saraogi, an investment advisor,  explains an important concept - ‘Sequence of Returns Risk.’
If you are simply investing a lump sum of money and leaving it untouched, the order of the returns you earn year after year does not matter. You will end up with the same final amount regardless of the sequence of those returns.
However, the sequence in which you earn returns can have a significant impact on the final value of an investment when periodic withdrawals or contributions are involved.
By the end of this video, you'll have a clear understanding of this concept and why it is essential to consider this in retirement planning.

17,Ep. 3 | Warren and Charlie's 25 Years at Berkshire | Warren's dismissal of Efficient Market Theory,"“Lose money for the firm, and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm, and I will be ruthless.”
These were Warren’s words to the employees of Salomon Brothers Inc., a troubled investment bank of which he had been chairman for 10 months in the early 1990s. 

In Episode 3, we cover Berkshire Hathaway’s years from 1987 to 1991 and discuss how Warren Buffett never minced his words when arguing over audit practices, accounting standards, investment banks, or CEOs. This is the period when Buffett first picked up a stake in Coca-Cola and Gillette. The highlight of the episode is that Buffett and Munger completed 25 years of running Berkshire Hathaway in 1990, and Buffett enlisted the mistakes he committed in those 25 years.

In this episode, Sankaran Naren, the Chief Investment Officer at ICICI Pru MF, shares the fund house’s approach to investing such large amounts of public money. Naren is known for his contrarian style of investing, which revolves around the belief that markets move in cycles and that these cycles always tend to mean revert.
What is it and how does it matter to you?
Imagine you are on a flight, and suddenly the plane hits turbulence. If you're not familiar with flying and don’t understand why turbulence occurs, you might panic, thinking the plane is in serious trouble. But if you know that turbulence is a common occurrence and that airplanes are designed to withstand it, you’re more likely to stay calm. Similarly, when you invest in a fund following a certain style, if you don’t know when that style works and when it doesn’t, your decisions will be impacted by panic and fear.
So, here you go: if you are an investor in any of the ICICI funds, you have to watch this entire episode.

In Episode 2, covering 1982 to 1986, we discuss the interesting businesses that Berkshire was buying and the even more interesting stories of those purchases. The formidable Mrs. B’s Nebraska Furniture Mart deserves a mention.

While Berkshire continued its acquisitions, Warren alerted his readers about the motives behind rampant mergers and acquisitions happening around. He displayed unpopular but thought-provoking views on efficient market theory while advising retail investors to invest in index funds.

How to Apply & Sell Rights Issue? #shorts #rightsissue,"A rights issue is a corporate action where an offer is made by a company to its existing shareholders to buy new shares in the company. The number of new shares offered is usually proportional to the number of existing shares held by the shareholder. The price at which the new shares can be purchased is usually at a discount to the current market price of the shares. 
In order to apply for these rights issues, shareholders need to have Rights entitlement.

As they go about helping Joshi Uncle shortlist the right place to buy sweets, flowers, and vegetables for the harvest festival, the kids learn some valuable lessons about being thoughtful about money and spending. 

Being thoughtful with money is not an easy thing. Most of our money choices are on autopilot, driven by our impulses. The word ""budget"" evokes dread in not just kids but even adults. Very few people enjoy looking over each and every expense. But the idea behind budgeting isn't about fussing over every expense; it's about being deliberate about our money choices. While this video is for kids, even grownups can learn a thing or two.

220,"Difference between face value, market value, and book value of a stock (Hindi)","When analyzing stocks, you will encounter metrics such as face value, book value, and market value. Although market value is something we are all familiar with, it is important to understand face value and book value. This is because corporate actions are based on or affect these metrics. For example, a stock split reduces the face value, and dividends are based on the face value. 
In order to get a sense of the intrinsic value of a stock, you need to understand what book value is.  

In this video, we look at the three values and also how the price-to-book to book (P/B ratio) is calculated in Hindi.

But the issue is there are 11 equity fund categories, 16 debt fund categories, and 6 hybrid fund categories among others. How do you go about picking the right fund for the right goal?

Analyzing debt mutual fund: https://youtu.be/1_2tzQVUqpM",2023-06-05,2832,96,0,OqOiJzVY-NY
224,Analyzing debt mutual funds,"One thing we've noticed over the years is investors spend a lot of time analyzing equity mutual funds and not enough time on debt funds. Just like equity funds, most investors pick funds based on star ratings, past returns or recommendations on finance news sites. This is a terrible idea because, all star ratings are based on past performance: higher the past returns, more the number of starts. The problem is, unlike equity funds, higher returns in debt always equals high risk. The only real way to generate high returns in debt is by investing in riskier bonds. So picking debt funds based on start ratings and past returns is a bad idea. 

The best way to choose debt funds is to understand the key risks in debt. Once you understand the risks, choosing debt funds, is really easy. In this video, Karthik explains the key data points and risks you should know when analyzing debt mutual funds. Read these chapters to learn more about debt funds: https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-debt-funds-part-1/",2023-06-05,31903,627,27,1_2tzQVUqpM

226,How to analyze an equity mutual fund?,"Let's say you have shortlisted a couple of equity mutual funds, how do you choose between those? While it's almost impossible to predict which fund will do better, you can ensure that you can pick funds that are well managed. Also, picking funds just by looking at the past return is a recipe for disaster. 

In this video, Karthik explains:
1. Why you shouldn't just look at point to point returns and instead look at rolling returns

228,Important mutual fund metrics when picking mutual funds,"So far in the series, we've discussed equity and debt mutual funds, how they work, and the risks. Putting all this together, once you get down to building your portfolio, you need to analyze funds before investing in them. So, the question is how do you pick mutual funds? Picking mutual funds is as much an art as it is science. There's no one guaranteed way to pick funds. But if you invert that question, whenever you are analyzing funds, you need to look at certain key metrics to evaluate them. In this video, Karthik explain key ratios like beta, alpha, and Sharpe ratio that are important when you're analyzing funds.

230,How do mutual funds earn money?,"So far in the series, we've discussed why you should invest, why mutual funds are ideal for long term investing, and the various types of mutual funds. If you are investing in a mutual fund, you need to pay the asset management company (AMC) to manage your money, but you don't pay anything every month from your pocket. You must be wondering if mutual funds are free. They aren't. Every mutual fund scheme has a fee, and this is called the total expense ratio (TER). This is the fee charged for managing your investment. 

Also, not all mutual fund schemes have the same expense ratios. Every mutual fund scheme comes in two variants: direct plans and regular plans. In this video, Karthik explains what an expense ratio is, how it is charged, and the difference between regular and direct plans.

232,Important debt fund jargon,"Most investors get intimidated by debt funds because they think it's much more complicated than equity. The end result is that they end up building imbalanced portfolios. Debt is a very simple asset class, it's pretty much basic math—all you need to understand is a couple of fundamental concepts. 

In this video, Karthik explains what Macaulay duration and modified duration are. These two concepts are important to understand when picking debt funds, analyzing their performance, and thinking about your asset allocation.

234,Getting started with debt mutual funds,"In the last video, we discussed equity mutual funds. Equities can be thought about as the growth asset class—they are volatile, but they have the highest expected returns. Now, in a portfolio that has a volatile asset class like equity, you need something stable to reduce the volatility as well as diversify. Why? Because having multiple asset classes that rise and fall at the same time makes no sense. This is the role that debt funds play. Debt funds invest in bonds issued by govt and companies when they borrow money. Bonds are less volatile than equities but offer stable and predictable returns. In this video, Karthik explains the basics of debt funds and the key risks.

Let's say, you decide to start investing in a mutual fund scheme, the units will be allotted to you at a specific price. This price is called the Net Asset Value (NAV). The NAV of a mutual fund scheme represents the current market value of your investments. Just like the price of a stock, the NAV of a mutual fund scheme changes every day based on the performance of the securities inside the scheme. Remember, a mutual fund is a wrapper that holds assets like stocks, bonds, and commodities like gold.

There are various regulatorily approved structures for managing money like: 
1. Portfolio management services (PMS)
2. Alternative investment funds (AIF)
3. Mutual funds (MF)

The first two are for high net worth individuals (HNIs) and the minimum investment in a PMS scheme is Rs 50 lakhs while it's Rs 1 crore in an AIF. For the rest of us, mutual funds are one of the best ways to save for all our goals. While the act of choosing a scheme is easy to understand, it's worthwhile to understand the structure of an asset management company (AMC) which launches a mutual fund scheme. In this video, Karthik explain how an AMC is structured and the various entities it interacts with.

246,Beginners guide to personal finance,"A common personal finance mistake we all make is not starting to invest early, even if we can. Maybe it's because of the youthful naïveté, but early on in our careers, we think that saving small amounts doesn't matter. We don't realize that even small amounts compounded over long periods of time will grow into large sums. At a very reductive level, the secret to personal finance is simple: 
1. Start early.
2. Invest regularly. 
3. Stay invested for the longest time possible. 
After a few decades, the value of your investments will be enough to give you a heart attack (in a good way 😀).

252,Does diversification increase your returns and reduce risk?,"""You shouldn't put all your eggs in one basket"" is a saying you would have heard a100 times when it comes to investing. The saying is often used to convey the idea you should always diversify your portfolio. 

But why should you diversify? 

In this video, Karthik explain the two major risks in your portfolio and how diversification helps in reducing those risks. 

Risk is an intuitive concept that people understand. But risk is omnipresent in the markets. Understanding what risk is, how to measure it can help you build a better portfolio. To learn about risk, please check out the risk management module: https://zerodha.com/varsity/module/risk-management/

Discussion about risk also leads to the question of whether you can hedge it. Lucky for you, we have a chapter dedicated to that: https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/hedging-futures/",2023-01-03,10758,373,19,C1j3asSi2tA
253,How to plan for longevity risk in retirement,"Most people, when they plan for their retirement, they look at the average life expectancy and then assume that's the age they will probably live to. However, averages can be misleading because they conceal the variation of people who do not live to the average life expectancy mark or live past it. When you are making your retirement assumptions, it's always better to be overprepared and save more with the assumption that you might live to be 100 years old or more. It's not really hypothetical because science is getting better all the time. In 1960, the average Indian life expectancy was 40 years, and in 2020 it was 70 years old. Not planning for a long life is called ""longevity risk,"" and most people don't intuitively think about it. 

So what does this mean in investing terms? You will have to have a higher equity exposure because equities in the long run have higher expected returns compared to all the other asset classes like debt, real estate, and gold. But this leads to questions like: what stocks, how to pick them, etc. 
But there's a much simpler, tax-efficient, evidence-backed, and historically proven way of investing in equities for the long run. In this video, Karthik explains how to think about longevity risk and how to invest to cover that risk. 

Of course, retirement is just one broader topic under personal finance. In case you didn't know, we have a dedicated module on personal finance on Varsity: https://zerodha.com/varsity/module/personalfinance/",2022-12-16,22485,1045,39,-BU8hyY-ZXk

You can find the best tipster on the planet, but at the end of the day, if you don't have your own framework to analyse the markets and then make trading or investing decisions, you'll never make money.

266,14. The Straddle,"As a trader, you'll have plenty of trades where you do a lot of homework and have conviction that a trade will work, but it goes against you. This is the obvious risk of trading directional trades, where you are expecting a stock to either go up or down and trade that with options. 

But you can also use certain option strategies that don't depend on the market direction and work regardless of how the market moves. Such option strategies are known as “delta neutral” strategies. In this video, we look at one such delta neutral strategy—the straddle. Also, just because these strategies make money regardless of the market move doesn't mean they are without risks. We also look at the risks of delta neutral strategies.

268,13. Bull Call Spread,"As we've learned from the previous videos, if you have a bullish view on a stock, you can buy a call or sell a put. But naked options trades can be risky if your view is wrong. One of the better ways to express a bullish view is by using multi-leg strategies, which involve buying and selling multiple options simultaneously, 

Let's take the same example. Let's say you're bullish on TCS. Instead of just selling a put and exposing yourself to directional risk, you can reduce the risk by sacrificing some upside but also capping the downside in case TCS falls. One such strategy is called a Bull Call Spread, where you buy an in the money (ITM) option and sell an out of the money option (OTM). In this video, we discuss how the bull call spread works.

270,What is inflation and what causes it?,"A coffee used to cost ₹25 in 2010, and today it costs ₹40—this is the typical example you hear when people explain what is inflation. There's nothing wrong with it, but there's more to inflation than just the price increase. It's important to understand the nuances since, inflation affects everything from how much you can invest to the returns on your investments. Even more so, given the phenomenal spike in inflation across the world, including India. 

In this video, Karthik explain what is inflation, what causes it and how do central banks like RBI try to control inflation. Along with the video, we'd recommend you read these two related Varsity chapters:

271,12. Physical settlement of futures and options,"Every option contract has an expiry. All F&O contracts expire on the last Thursday of every month. Until 2018, all F&O contracts were cash settled. Meaning, on expiry, there was no need to deliver or take delivery of the underlying shares of the contract. But in 2018 SEBI made physical delivery mandatory. So, if you hold a F&O contract till expiry, you either need to deliver shares or take delivery of share once the contract expires.

 In this video, we'll explore what is physical settlement, why is it needed and how positions are settled.

273,11. Margins,"When trading options, you'll hear a term called ""margin."" It's nothing but the money required to buy or sell an option. Margin requirements are different for futures, call options and put options. They are also dynamic and change with volatility. Knowing how margins are calculated is important when trading options because it helps you deploy and manage your capital appropriately. 

In this video, we look how margins are calculated for simple directional trades and when you hedge positions.

274,10. Vega,"So far, in the series we've learned about three option greeks—delta, gamma and theta. In this video, we'll discuss vega—the fourth and final greek. One of the factors that you need to consider when taking an options trade is the market volatility. In simple terms, volatility is a measure of how much the markets move up and down. The reason why you need to know about volatility is because it impacts option premiums. When markets are more volatile, premiums are higher and vice versa. So now that you know that volatility increases option premiums, how much do they increase by? This is what vega tells you. The Vega of an option measures the rate of change of option’s value (premium) with every percentage change in volatility. 

Before you learn more about Vega, it's important that you have an understanding of what volatility is and how it is measured. Check out these chapters to learn more:

275,9. Theta,"In the previous video, we learned about gamma. It helps you figure out the rate of change of delta for a given change in the underlying. By now, you know that options have an expiry date, and they keep losing value as they approach the expiry. Knowing this important when you're taking a trade. So, how do you figure out the rate at which an option will lose its premium as it approaches expiry? 

This is where theta comes in. theta helps you figure out the rate at which an option loses value as time passes, and it is expressed in points. Learn more about theta here: https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/theta/",2022-05-20,56543,679,16,fDLJlU8OdP8
276,8. Gamma,"In the previous video, we learned about delta, one of the option greeks. Delta helps you figure out the change in premium for a given change in the underlying price. But how do you  figure out the rate at which delta changes? These where gamma comes in, it helps you figure out the change in delta for a given change in  the underlying. 

Check out this Varsity chapter to learn more about gamma: https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/gamma-part-1/",2022-05-13,64561,659,12,koJQc3fqxjk
277,7. The Option Greeks - Delta,"In the previous video, we learned about the concept of moneyness of an option. This helps you identify if an option is the in the money, at the money, or out of the money. In this video we move to greeks and there are 4 major ones you need to know when trading options: Delta, Gamma, Vega  and Theta.

By now, you know that when the underlying of an option changes, the option premium too changes. But how do you figure out how much the option premium would change if for a given change in the price of the underlying? This is where delta comes in. It helps you figure by how many points the option premium would change for every 1 point change in the underlying. We'll learn about the other 3 greeks in the upcoming videos. 

Learn more about Delta of an option here: https://zerodha.com/varsity/chapter/the-option-greeks-delta-part-1/",2022-05-04,109232,1143,29,I7YWC_j1ocI
278,6. Moneyness of option,"In the previous video, we summarized all that we have learned about call options and put options. We also ended the video with the following questions: 
1. Who sets the premium?
2. Which strike price to trade? 
3. What are factors that influence premiums? 

In this video, we discuss the concept of moneyness of an option which will help us answer these questions. Moneyness tells you whether you'll make money or lose money if you were to excerise the option. These are 3 classifications of moneyness: 
1. In the Money (ITM)
2. At the Money (ATM)
3. Out of the Money (OTM) 

These classifications will help you understand whether you'll make or lose money. In this video, we understand all these 3 terms.

318,3. How to read the annual report of a company,"Annual reports are comprehensive documents published by listed companies each year. They contain both financial and non-financial information about the company. Reading an annual report is very important if you are fundamentally analyzing a company to make an investment decision. But not everything in the annual report is useful, and there's a lot of irrelevant information and in a lot of cases marketing fluff. 

So, you need to know what to look for and what to ignore when analyzing annual reports. In this video, we look at the structure of annual reports and the important sections you need to focus on. For example, an auto company might talk about its various product segments, giving you an insight into the segments that are driving most of the revenues. Similarly, annual reports have a section on corporate governance which has details about the management, the directors, their background and their remuneration and these things are quite important.
