If you ever meet me, you might think I’m in great shape, in a good mood, and not at all stressed. But you couldn’t be further from the truth.

In reality, ever since The 1% Club started growing like crazy, I:

- haven’t been sleeping properly
- don’t always follow my diet
- feel overwhelmed often
- worry about the future

So, I figured I needed more than just a break but a chance to recalibrate my health.

That’s why I spent a whole week in Chennai at India’s most unique health center,AIWO . Here’s what I discovered as I worked on my longevity:

🏃‍♂️ Fitness Score:
💆‍♂️ Skincare Upgrade:
🧘‍♂️ Posture Check:
💉 Blood Work:
🛌 💤 Sleep Stats:

This experience made me realize that my first priority should be my health. Because if you’re not going to live to see your dreams come true, then what’s the f—ing point?!

P.S: Makes me wonder, how much would you spend to live for 100 years?

- feel overwhelmed often
- worry about the future

It has taken a toll on my overall health, body, and mood, which gets in the way of progress. As a founder, I can't let my team down.

So, I figured I needed more than just a break but a chance to recalibrate my health.

That's why I spent a whole week in Chennai at India's most unique health center,AIWO . Here's what I discovered as I worked on my longevity:

🏃‍♂️ Fitness Score:

First, they tested how much oxygen my muscles use during an intense exercise session. Mine turned out to be average around 42. Athletes usually have 50+. I reach my zone 4 heartbeat levels pretty quickly, which indicates a weak heart. I need to also do cardio. Just going to the gym isn’t enough. I should not run a lot. It will lead to muscle loss. For fat loss, I need to jog.

💆‍♂️ Skincare Upgrade:

I found out AI is now even providing people with a unique 90-minute facial! It included some muscle stimulation (I think it's the first of its kind in India).

🧘‍♂️ Posture Check:

As most of you know, I’ve been having severe neck pain for almost 6 months now. Turns out my posture is horrible. A 5.5kg head weighs 11kg for me because of my bad neck and shoulder posture. I learned how to fix that.

💉 Blood Work:

I got a super detailed blood test that checked 180+ things! This helped me realize some areas for improvement like cholesterol (140+), high cortisol (3x higher than the max level, indicating high stress levels), and very low levels of essential vitamins.

I learned that just being within the recommended range level is not called healthy. Most blood tests suggest ranges so that you don’t fall sick and not for operating at your peak level.

🛌 💤 Sleep Stats:

Last but not least! Their sleep test revealed I wasn't getting the quality rest I needed.

This experience made me realize that my first priority should be my health. Because if you're not going to live to see your dreams come true, then what's the f--ing point?!

P.S: Makes me wonder, how much would you spend to live for 100 years?

Well, BluSmart is the perfect example of it. 

👉🏻 The most important thing they did to set themselves apart from the competition was to understand the drivers’ pain points.

They figured out that it’s important for them to remain debt-free so that they can enjoy the money they earn. 

More importantly, BluSmart made sure that they weren’t overburdened and remained stress-free which could lead to better customer experiences.

Amazing, right? 💯

54,Retiring Early Does NOT Mean.. #financewithsharan #shorts,"Retire Early - most people misunderstand this term by thinking if I make x amount of money then I can chill and watch Netflix all day. 

That’s not the answer and you don’t want that life. 

What you want to achieve Is COAST FIRE as explained in the video. 

Even though the money is aside, you still gotta work for your daily expenses. You kept enough money in your 40s itself, so that one day when you’re 60, that money will take care of you.

56,Office Tour #financewithsharan #shorts,"New offices are usually shown with a lot of glam. But I wanted to be real about it.

I spent 3 years working 17 hours, sacrificing enjoyment, and much more & ONLY THEN have I been able to stand at @onepercentclub new office!

- In my early days, I used to do research at 5am
- Worked 9am-7pm for KPMG and PwC
- Researched again from 7-10pm
- Shot videos every weekend

For 3 long years without fail.

It was frea*in difficult.

But when you work like that day and night for so long, it’s impossible for your life to stay the same. It’s my challenge to you.

Last year, we had around 8-9 people and now we are 80+ strong!

We’ve also grown to over 11 departments, all passionate about finance, under one roof!

New office reveals are usually a show-off but the moment I stepped inside, I felt I’d have to do more to “earn” this.

To me, this isn’t just a place to work. It is the fruit of all the efforts made in the past. A place where we all let our creativity flow.

Every corner of this office, from reception to my Harvey Specter-inspired cabin, is made with a commitment to innovate and grow 100x. As Raghav said, expansion is our mission.

Dreams do come true when you work hard for them. 

But the success of The 1% Club will forever be dedicated to our growing community.

So, a big thank you to you all for being a part of our story! ❤️

59,Don’t Run A Business If You Can’t Do This #financewithsharan #shorts,"I spoke to the extraordinary Mr. Fabien Pinckaers, the founder and CEO of a unicorn company, Odoo. 

It’s a Belgium-based company valued at over €3.75 billion. And despite being a billionaire, he is so grounded and lives a very simple life 🙌🏻

Today he has around 4000 employees in his company. However, when he started the business, he had a very small team. 

👉🏻 From zero to the first 10 employees, he did all the work by himself. This is something that most of us can relate to when starting a new venture. Growing the business from 0 to 10 employees was extremely difficult for him, even harder than scaling from 100 to 1000 employees later on.

➡️ Hope you have watched the video on my YouTube channel.

While taking life insurance you will notice a box asking if you’d like to endorse the policy under the Married Woman Protection Act 📝

By checking the box, you ensure that no matter what the sum value in the event of anything happening to you goes to your wife. 

Policies under the MWP act, are entirely transferrable to the wife - it protects the payout from even creditors that the husband may have. 

👉🏻 However, once a policy is taken under the MWP Act you cannot disable such a policy, the only way to remove the features covered under the MWP Act is by closing the policy altogether ❌

⚠️ REMEMBER - To close/surrender a policy covered under the MWP Act, one has to get it signed by the beneficiary which is your wife. And any surrender charges are paid directly to your wife.

Vineeta Singh, Co-founder and CEO, SUGAR Cosmetics, gave a well-thought and interesting answer to this question that tells a lot about India’s retail revolution 🇮🇳

The Amazon marketplace has helped many retail businesses go national.

👉🏻 The best part is that such businesses dont require you to infuse a crazy amount of working capital into them. 

Moreover, you can generate healthy profits once you find your differentiator ✨

Such marketplaces have been the very reason why you can find successful retail businesses at every nook and corner of the country.

📍I discussed many such interesting insights in my podcast with the sharks, do check it out on my YouTube channel.

69,Smoker’s Guide To Buying Term Insurance #financewithsharan #shorts,"Smoking is injurious to health 🚬

In India 🇮🇳, a significant number of insurance claims get rejected because people fail to disclose important health-related information to their insurance provider.

The issue is that we observe the insurance company as someone who is always against us.

We need to understand that since you're paying premiums, it's well within your rights to file a claim.

However, we often feel that disclosing information might have negative impact on our policy.

But that's not the case.

If you disclose the information well in advance, then you won't have to worry about anything at the time of the claim.

Hence, you should always try to maintain open and honest communication with your insurance company.

Having a good understanding of your funds’ returns is extremely pivotal in moving a step closer to your financial goals 💸

➡️ Just like Warren Buffet, your goal for your investments should be to beat the index by a considerable percentage.

That involves learning about investing in a disciplined manner and it’s important to devote those 30 mins to 1 hour every day to make sure that you fulfil all your financial aspirations 🕰️ 

Moreover, let’s not forget, you have a bunch of advantages over a normal mutual fund. 💯 Hence, you can put those to work and make much higher gains.

⚠️ But, dont aim for a crazy amount of returns in your very first investment and end up burning your investable money. 

Do your research cautiously, set realistic goals and then take the final call 🙌🏻

78,Your Fault You’re Not Rich? Ft. Robert Kiyosaki #financewithsharan #shorts,"Do you agree?

“What Do I Want?” 🙋🏻

That is the question you must ask yourself whenever you are about to take that life-altering decision.

I know tons of talented people who have their own “What could have been?” stories but I know very few who take the guts to pursue their ambitions 💪🏻

➡️ This doesn’t mean you should quit your job and start a business or not do an MBA, if its something that you want, you should go ahead with it!

Taking that leap of faith is extremely important.

The full podcast with @therealkiyosaki is on my YouTube channel :)

83,Investing While Working 9 To 5 #financewithsharan #shorts,"Hobbies mostly cost money 💰 

Hence, investing shouldn’t be treated as a hobby because it’s supposed to be the catalyst for your financial goals.

I firmly believe that disciplined investing is very important because if you are going to be doing it just for the sake of it then might as well give the money to learned individuals who can get you higher returns 🤑

That way you can keep the stress of picking the right assets away from yourself.

➡️ However, if you learn properly about the financial parameters and plan to invest diligently towards your goals then you should certainly take it up yourself.

I had various such interesting discussions with Jimeet Modi, Founder of SAMCO Securities Limited, in my recent podcast.

87,Car Insurance Is Waste Without This #financewithsharan #shorts,"Did you know that on average a car 🚘 depreciates about 15-18% in the 1st year itself?

So, while you might be thinking that you dont need to worry about your car door getting a dent because you have car insurance, you should be prepared for a big blow to your savings. 🤯

Why? Because once you apply for a claim after a year, the insurance company will not pay for the total original price of that part.

They will pay the depreciated price which will be about 15-20% less. Hence, you might have to shell out from your savings. 💰 

Now, this is unfair, right?

Therefore, you should always get a ⚡️Zero Depreciation Cover ⚡️while getting car insurance.

It’s like a tool that helps you save money while applying for a claim.

If you have a Zero Depreciation Cover, the insurance company will pay for the entire original amount of the part and you won’t lose any money due to depreciation. 

Undoubtedly, it’s a must-have!

Well, if not then it’s high time you do so!

After all, retirement has been one of the most important goals for every working professional! 💼 

If you are a young individual starting out, then you have a major advantage over others i.e. your risk appetite.

👉🏻 Thus, you can allocate a major portion of your portfolio towards EQUITY.

However, one shouldn’t underestimate the importance of diversification in doing so, because where you invest your money is also important.

🌟 If you want to learn more about investments, check out my recent conversation with Jimeet Modi to understand more about trading markets, how to diversify your portfolio, and how to acquire a winning mindset.

90,Early Stage Startup Tips #financewithsharan #shorts,"India 🇮🇳 is at the helm of the startup revolution happening around the world.

In such a scenario, when we want to become global leaders, it’s important for startup founders to prioritise ! 🌍 

During my early days as a founder, I learnt that “Growth” shouldn’t be compromised.

That doesn’t mean that a founder should just burn money without thinking about the profitability. 

They need to invest into resources that give them great returns in the long-run ✅ 

Also I feel, if you optimise growth revenue well, profitability will become a by-product of it.

👉🏻 Hence, a responsible founder should take both these things hand in hand and not just focus on a single north-star metric.

97,Why Term Insurance Is Important #financewithsharan #shorts,"Don’t wait to get a term insurance late into your life. You never know when life will through problems at you. 

Term insurance premiums are cheaper when bought in your 20s than in your 30s & 40s. And there is no better day to get insured than today. 

That said with over 24 companies offering various kinds of life insurance products, it can be difficult to figure out the insurance that is the right fit for you. 

This is why I suggest talking to an expert like Ditto. Ditto offers a free consultation to help you purchase the proper term insurance and help you with the claim settlement for free.

Of course, you have come across such reels and videos from various influencers in the past. 

In comparison to these reels, my topics seemed extremely boring and that was probably one of the biggest creative challenges that I faced 🧠 

However, this challenge also gave me one of the best learnings that eventually it’s all about providing the right value to the people 💯

Now, since my topics weren’t that tempting, I had to come up with a different storyline, jokes, characters  and what not to make them interesting. 

💪🏻 By providing the right combination of important executable insights + entertainment, I was able to carve a niche for myself. 

And a big thanks for that goes to all of you who kept on supporting, appreciating and at times helping me improve my content game 🙏🏻

But so are expenses!

Unfortunately, all the major Big Diwali Sales are also over which means that you will be splurging a crazy amount of money leading to a giant hole in your savings.

Since I am a huge sucker for discounts, I like to compare prices and even put price alerts across different websites to get the best prices.

The major problem is that when a festival is so close, you do not have a lot of time to become a discount hacker.

That’s why you should use Hubble.

They give up to 10% discounts on brands like Zomato, Swiggy, Nykka, Amazon, Giva, Jimmy Choo and many more throughout the year.

But what’s the catch?

Nothing! Yes, you read that right, absolutely no catch. 

They believe in honest discounting and stay true to it. 

So, what are you waiting for? The link is in my bio!

From earning 12 / month selling computers to a 4 Cr salary at Axis Bank.

For this episode, I got to talk to Mr. Karan Datta, the Ex-Chief Business Officer of Axis Mutual funds, starting from his journey as a computer salesman to eventually joining Axis Mutual funds.

Karan decided to retire at the peak of his career in his mid-40s, fueled by his passion for sports.  We covered topics such as how he managed to build and maintain his 20Cr portfolio, when and why someone should consider retirement, and much more. 
 
A big thanks to Karan once again for joining me on the show. And I highly recommend you watch the episode in full, trust me, his life is a roller coaster you will want to experience

Entering your card data such as number, expiry date, CVV etc every time you are making an online transaction is extremely annoying. 🥲

Therefore, VISA has introduced CVV-Free Payments.

What’s so special about it❓

When you save your card details on any website, it is encrypted with a unique code, keeping your actual data safe and secure. ✅

So with Visa’s CVV-Free payments, you can just place your order, enter the OTP shared on your mobile 📱 and payment will be completed.

Simple, right?

Unquestionably, this makes all our online purchases safer, more secure and convenient!

You appear for countless interviews and rounds and finally get your contract. In this jubilation, you forget to check your CTC. 🙃

Most of the freshers plan on what to do with their first salary, but when we receive it, reality hits.

Most freshers do not understand the difference between In-hand salary and CTC. 

➡️ While your CTC might say 15 Lakhs, you should look at it closely to check if there’s any retention bonus component the company will give only if you stay for a certain period.

People are under the impression that employee bonds are illegal! Well, they are not ❌

Your company can exercise a reasonable penalty if you don’t comply with the rules.

So, don’t unquestioningly accept an offer by looking at the astonishingly high CTC. 

Do your research, negotiate well on the in-hand component, and read the T&Cs properly! 🙌🏻

Not anymore! Your man has a hack for this too! 💪 

Do you know what happens to the display pieces that you see at big electronic stores? All those smart TVs that fill the entire wall of the shop? Or that sexy 16” MacBook Pro on display?

Yes, you can get those at 20-30% discount! Don’t believe me? try next time you wanna buy some high end electronic item like laptop, smartwatch, DSLR camera 📸 or even a trendy mobile phone.

You may have to put up with a battery performance that is somewhat reduced. Also, warranty period may be lesser than usual. But those are adjustable things IMHO if I am getting a 30% discount. 🙆‍♂️ What say? 

Caveat: You can only do this when the new models are out. For example for Apple you can go during April and September to ask for display pieces of the previous models.

123,Most People Don’t Know This About Me #financewithsharan #shorts,"“Rome wasn't built in a day.”

I completely resonate with the quote above because that’s been the journey of The 1% Club.

Not many people know this but Finance With Sharan literally came into existence, just to make my MBA application look good. 

A lot of hard work went into it, which led me to get into Columbia University, an Ivy League institute. 

Letting go of this opportunity was one of the hardest thing I ever did - in order to grow what I had started, that is to help people achieve financial independence.

While being praised for my content, I realized that the larger goal was to raise financial awareness amongst the country's middle class.

That's when the idea of The 1% Club was born.

I started with my “Personal Finance Masterclass,” but one thing was evident: I cannot let it become a forum where I’m the only one talking.

It has to be a place where people who want to get control of their finances get together and help each other out !

What started with creating videos on a broken phone has now helped 50,000+ people become financially independent or on their journey to become financially free

It’s been one hell of a ride till now, but there’s a long way to go!

127,Compounding Is The 8th Wonder Of The World  #financewithsharan #shorts,"Remember piggybanks? 🐷 

We’d drop our spare change in, watching it grow slowly. But as adults, that piggybank approach isn’t enough to fulfill our dreams and goals! 

We need something effective, aka Investing!💡

While saving is crucial, investing is a much more important part. Think of it as a plant –if you want that plant to grow, you must nurture it with investment. 🌱

Most banks offer a 3-4% return on savings accounts, while inflation is approximately 7%. 

So, while your savings might inch up in your bank account, the devil-named inflation will keep eroding their value. 

According to a survey, 78% of Indians will not invest in 2023 due to recession fears and market volatility.

This isn’t a wise decision because long-term planning can easily tackle this volatility.

Investing isn’t just about money; it’s about securing your future, achieving dreams, and attaining financial freedom. 

By investing, you harness the power of compound interest and market growth, allowing your wealth to flourish. 📈
So, start your journey from piggybank to portfolio today! 🏦 

Your future self will thank you for it. 💯

134,Watch This To Save Lakhs In Taxes By Using Parents #financewithsharan #shorts,"There is nothing certain in this world apart from Death and Taxes. 

Now, I’m no shaman who can revive you from death however, I can help you save a bit extra on your taxes if you follow this hack. 

You must have heard of tax profit harvesting. If not, no worries. It’s a method through which you can cut down on your long-term capital gains taxes from mutual funds and listed equities. 

LTCG on the sale of these investments is 10%. However, gains up to the first INR 1 lakh are exempt, meaning you need only pay tax on the gains over 1 lakh. 

So, by redeeming your investments every year and booking gains up to 1 lakh, you can pay little to no tax during your final redemption. 

But that’s the case only if your corpus is small. A larger corpus is likely to have capital gains over INR 1 lakh, meaning you couldn’t take full benefit of the tax profit harvesting method. 

So here’s the hack: You gift your parents a portion of the corpus. They will invest this amount in their name. This way, you and your parents can maintain smaller portfolios and benefit from tax profit harvesting. 

Since your parents fall under the definition of family under the Income Tax Act, gifting money to them does not attract the ire of the income tax department.

137,This Is How You Manage Retirement Money #financewithsharan #shorts,"Where would you like to retire? Ibiza? Amsterdam? Moon? (Courtesy to ISRO the 3rd one seems like a real possibility) 🏖️

Well, no matter what your dream retirement looks like, building a required corpus for it is extremely important💰 

What’s more important? Ensuring that the retirement money which you have built over the years doesnt get depleted in a few years.

We have a lot of responsibilities towards our loved ones and obviously we would like to provide for them and fulfill all their wishes even when we have retired 👴🏻

So, what can you do to achieve this?

Use the Equity Glidepath Method!

How does it work?

Well, lets say you are 3 years close to your retirement. 

Then, you should divide your retirement money and put it in the ratio of 70:30 between debt and equity respectively.

With every passing year, increase 3% of the invested sum into equity. By the age of 70, you would have 60% in equity and 40% in debt.

This way your retirement money will last much longer.

Therefore, now you can retire in peace and age like a fine wine!

139,Medical Emergency Finance #financewithsharan #shorts,"According to the IRDAI, just over 30% of Indians are covered under a health scheme or Insurance. However, medical emergencies happen without prior intimation, and good treatment can often be expensive. 

This means that you’ll have to fork out cash from your end to meet these medical expenses. However, few of us are prepared to meet such contingencies at short notice. 

This often leads to the desperate taking expensive personal loans at high-interest rates (16%-24%) to meet these unforeseen medical emergencies. 

However, there is a cheaper way to pay off your medical bills. The answer is simple: withdraw money from your PF account to meet your medical bills. 

The patient is allowed to withdraw up to 6 months of their basic salary. However, they should submit all medical bills to the EPFO office within 45 days of discharge to avail the withdrawal facility. 

In the case of an emergency, you can withdraw 1 lakh immediately from your PF account. However, this is allowed only if hospitalization is done in a government hospital.

141,Life Insurance Hack That You Need To Know #financewithsharan #shorts,"What If I told You….

Around 60.6% of people stop paying their life insurance premiums 💰 within 5 years of purchasing the policy ! 

The sentiment is, ”I’m healthy. Why do I need an insurance?”

However, we must remember that our lives are constantly surrounded by uncertainty. Therefore, having a life insurance policy at all times is essential. 🙌🏻

If you are one of those, who have stopped paying their insurance premiums due to which your policy has lapsed…

I have a question for you: Policy Revival or New Policy?

For the unaware, you can revive your lapsed policy if you pay back all remaining premiums and penalties, which range around 8-10% on unpaid premiums.
 
Depending on the company, the revival period can average between 3-5 years.

Now, a question might arise in your mind. “Why not just take a new policy?”

Well, you need to understand that if you take up a new policy, your premiums will be calculated as per your current age, which will be much higher.

Moreover, you can always negotiate the penalty amount with your existing insurance provider.

👉🏻 So I’m asking again, which method do you choose?

142,Who Will Get Your Money When You Die? #financewithsharan #shorts,"Don’t let your assets play hide and seek! Make a will to secure your legacy 💸

Did you know that a whopping 82,000 crores are lying unclaimed in India 🇮🇳? It’s not a treasure hunt, it’s the result of people neglecting to make a will 📝 

Nominees are not the legal successors of your assets. Even if you’ve designated someone as a nominee, it doesn’t guarantee their ownership rights. So, what’s the solution? 

➡️ A will !

A will acts as the ultimate document that ensures your assets are distributed according to your wishes after you’re gone. It’s like a personalized roadmap for your wealth! 💰

By making a will, you take control of your assets and ensure they are distributed in the manner they were intended. 

Whether you’re young or old, wealthy or just surviving, making a will will ensure rightful people inherit your assets and help avoid legal complications and potential conflicts among family members. 

👉🏻 So make sure to consult a legal expert and prepare a will at the earliest. Remember, it’s never too early, but it can be too late!

143,Don’t Make This Mistake While Getting Education Loan #financewithsharan #shorts,"Are you considering going abroad for higher education? ✈️ 

Unless you are loaded, you’ll have to take an education loan to fund your educational expense 🥲

Unfortunately, education loans can be expensive, with interest rates as high as 9-12%. However, there is a way for you to get up to 30% off through section 80E of the income tax act. 

👉🏻 80E allows you to claim interest paid on an education loan as a deduction against your taxable income. That said, if you are going abroad and plan to work there, then you wouldn’t have taxable income in India, under which the deductions can be claimed. 

Instead, you can have your parents 👨‍👩‍👧 be a co-applicant for your loan if they are working in India. This way, they can claim 80E deduction. And effectively reduce the interest paid on education loans by lowering their tax liability. 

Send this reel to your friend who is going to be married to a firangi soon. 😇

144,How To Calculate Life Insurance Amount? #financewithsharan #shorts,"Do you have a plan set up for a rainy day? 🌧️ 

What happens if you were to meet with an unfortunate accident? Is your family well equipped to meet their financial needs then? 🤯

This is why it is integral that you get a ✨Life Insurance Policy✨

But the question arises how big of a policy do you need? 🧐

Well, that depends on you, and I have an easy way for you to calculate how much sum you should be insuring your life for. 

It’s called the DIME method; 

D:- stands for debt, covering any personal debts you carry.
I:- stands for income. This amounts to how much your dependents would require to meet their needs. 
M:- stands for the mortgage, which is the home loan pending currently. 
E:- stands for education, the amount you’ll need to meet your children’s education fees until independence. 

This week I’m writing a newsletter 📧 on the subject of life insurance for my email audience where I’ll cover the entire topic and give special access to a tool through which you can calculate your ideal sum insured amount yourself.

145,Do This To Save Tax ft. Ahsaas Channa  #financewithsharan #shorts,"Did you know that pre-2018, there were no taxes on long-term capital gains from equity and equity-oriented products? 👏🏻

However, the government imposed a 10% tax on long-term capital gains of over INR 1 lakh on equity products made after January 31st. 😭

Now paying taxes 💰has become an inevitability. That said, you can still significantly reduce your tax liability by using ✨TAX PROFIT HARVESTING✨

Here’s how it works down👇🏻

Let’s  say you have a corpus of 8 lakhs and have made a gain of INR 1 lakhs. You sell those mutual funds and immediately purchase them back to book the gains.

LTCG on equity is not taxed if it’s under INR 1 lakh, you needn’t pay taxes on those gains booked. 

So in the future year, when you sell your mutual funds, the cost of mutual funds purchased would be nine lakhs instead of eight lakhs, allowing you to pay lesser to nil taxes 💯

Thanks, @theviralfever for making this collab happen 🙏🏻

146,How To Split Wedding Expenses,"Banks 🏦 are the cornerstone of every economy, so a failing banking infrastructure can be devastating for the country. 

Over the past few months, we’ve heard notable banks fail in the world’s largest economy- The United States, but what if the same happened in India 🇮🇳 ?

Don’t worry about it, the RBI has your back. The RBI has insured all depositor accounts like savings, fixed, current, recurring, etc.

However, there is a catch. 🥲

The insurance is only up to 5 lakhs of the total interest and principal per account holder with a bank. This means that if you have over five lakhs in an account, you are at risk, especially dealing with small finance banks 💰 

Fortunately, there is a way around it; you can split your money and deposit it in the same bank but as different holders. The RBI 🇮🇳 considers joint accounts as different holders from the individual. 

This way you can split your corpus between your spouse, and yourself, a joint account with you as the primary account holder, and a joint account with your wife as the primary account holder. 💯

Thus ensuring your corpus is safe even in times of a banking collapse.

148,Best Way To Pay Off Home Loan #financewithsharan #shorts,"Most people fall into a debt trap unassumingly. 😞

They do not realize how EMIs are piling one after the other and only know they are trapped when they start missing payments ❌

Fortunately, you can escape a debt trap even if you do not have the income to make the EMIs. 🤩 

One way would be to withdraw your PF to repay your home loan 🏡 You can withdraw up to 90% of your PF for home loan repayment. 

Once you’ve made your home loan payment, you can concentrate on paying off other high-interest debt like credit card loans and personal loans. 💳 

You can also use your PF corpus to make the downpayment for your home loan. 

⚠️ But it is important to note that your PF is essentially your retirement fund and any withdrawal you make should be replaced so you can achieve your retirement goals.

I mean, what can go wrong while on a week-long trip abroad? Well, on the off chance you do get sick, you are in for a ride when the medical bill arrives. 🏥

Your domestic health insurance isn’t valid for medical events outside of India ❌ And what’s worse? 1st world countries often charge a lot more for consultation and treatment. 

To ensure your safety while seeing the sights, it’s essential that you purchase a ✨ Foreign Travel Insurance ✨

➡️ Travel insurance will insure you on medical treatment abroad, loss of passport, loss of baggage, and lots more, all at an affordable rate of around INR 1.5k-3k for a two-week trip abroad.

152,Save Tax While BUYING HOUSE ! #shorts #financewithsharan,"Do you dream about owning your very own house? 🏡 

Well, let me tell you a secret way by which you could save on taxes 💰while taking a lesser risk. 

Your first order of business, once you decide to purchase a house, is to start investing money to pay for the downpayment 💸

However, when you sell your investments when making your downpayment, you’ll end up having to pay taxes on the gains made. 

👉🏻 Here’s how you can avoid doing so :

Say you invested 20 lakhs in Equity MFs 5 years back, hoping to use it for the downpayment. You plan to purchase the house 1-2 years from now. 

Since equity is risky in the short run, you want to move the money to an FD. However, this would bring a tax of 10% on the redemption of MFs 🤯

So you redeem the MFs and invest the entire sale value into a Capital Gains Account Scheme - Type B account under section 54F. This account is like a regular FD where you can deposit money and withdraw it only to purchase a house. 

If you purchase a house within two years from the redemption of MFs, you needn’t pay any taxes on the MFs while also protecting the money from stock market influences by moving it towards the CGAS FD 🎉

153,Beware Of This CREDIT CARD FRAUD !,"How often does your relationship manager pester you? 🤬

Now I’m sure most of us are annoyed by the constant calls the banks 🏦 make to us trying to sell us their services. 

Unfortunately, scammers have seen this trend and have started posing as bank employees to dupe us out of our money 😓

These scammers pose as bank employees 🙎🏻‍♂️ and offer services like extending bank loans and increasing your credit limit. 

They then send you an unverified link asking you to enter sensitive bank details like OTP. By entering your OTP, you are debited/scammed out of your money 💰 

➡️ This is why it’s essential that you do not enter or divulge bank details to anyone. Your bank will never ask you for an OTP, and before entering such details on a website, ensure the website is secure. 

⚠️ As many as 2,400 such fraud cases happened last year involving 87 crores, so keep yourself and your loved ones safe by keeping them updated about such scams.

154,Easiest Way To FILE TAXES !,"Do you want the income tax office to be sending you letters? 👮🏻‍♀️ 

If not, you better be filing your income tax returns 💰 before July 31st. 

(Stay tuned for a bonus tip towards the end)

But filing your tax returns can be quite stressful 😩

👉🏻 Firstly you’ll need to find a CA you trust and then collect the documents and information required to complete your returns all of which will take you a day at the very least. 

However, there is a way to shorten this process down to a couple of hours. That is if you file your returns through Cleartax. 

Cleartax will prefill all your details through the PAN and Adhaar information you provide and select the tax regime under which you’ll pay the least tax 💯

They also allow you to fetch your capital gains data straight from your broker and set off any capital losses with your gains. 

➡️ Filing returns has never been easier, and you can also use my Coupon Code CTSHARAN60 to get a flat 60% off on DIY ITR plans on Cleartax.

155,Gold Jewellery Is NOT AN INVESTMENT - But This Is !!,"Imagine you are in dire need of money 💰 

What do you think is the best to source it? The easiest option would be to use your credit card or take a personal loan. 💳 

But personal and credit card loans have rates as high as 20-40%, making them far too expensive and should be avoided at all costs if you have access to a cheaper source of credit. 😭 

I’m talking about a loan against ⚡️SOVEREIGN GOLD BONDS⚡️ with a much cheaper interest rate of 10.5%-12%. If you hold SGBs, you can take a loan amounting to 65% of the SGB’s value. 

So if you bought SGBs during the latest issue, you could take a loan against them at any point as long as you hold them. However, If you don’t invest in SGBs, you have the option to take a loan against your mutual funds instead. 

➡️ Under a loan against mutual funds, you’ll be able to get up to 50% of your MFs value as a loan. 

Since gold and SGBs give the highest loan amounts, they are preferred over taking a loan against a mutual fund.

157,Use Your PROVIDENT FUND The Right Way !!,"Comment down below what you’d want to ask your future-self 🚀 

Do you hate how your employer deducts your salary in the name of PF? 😭

Trust me, your PF is a powerful tool you should be taking advantage of 🙌🏻

Firstly a disclosure, your PF is meant for your retirement, and you shouldn’t be jeopardizing your retirement for other personal goals 🎯

Interest on your PF is tax-free for a contribution of up to INR 2.5 lakhs in one year. This contains both your contribution as well as your employer’s contribution.💰

If you have completed 7 years of employment, you will be eligible to withdraw up to 50% of your PF account for your or your children’s wedding 💒 

So in my eg, if you have five lakhs in your account & your father 👨🏻 has 15 lakhs, & contributes INR 2.5 lakhs each into each of your PF’s for the next 4 years — on the year of your wedding, you can withdraw INR 8.6 lakhs and your dad can withdraw 13.6 lakhs from your respective PF accounts. 

You must submit Form 31 to the PF office to withdraw from your PF account.

158,Don’t Let Your Employer Do This To You 🤯,"You must have noticed that your employer/buyer rarely pays you the total amount you are owed. 😭

This is because tax deducted at source (TDS) is deducted from your salary/invoice. And this TDS amount is deposited with the government. 💸

However, in many cases, the TDS deductor may forget to pay the TDS deducted to the government. In such cases, you may fail to claim the TDS as a refund 💰 or charge against your taxes while filing your tax returns.

This is why checking your 26AS before the end of every year is essential. There, you’ll be able to check if all your TDS has been deposited with the government on not 💯 

If the TDS is not showing in your 26AS, you can still claim it while filing your returns. However, you may receive a notice from the government. 

If you do, then make sure to send all related salary slips, bank statements, and invoices to the government as proof that the TDS was deducted but failed to be deposited by the depositor.

159,Your Car Loan Just Got CHEAPER !! Ft. Rida Tharana,"The average credit score of Indians is only 715, as per a report published by one score a credit score monitoring platform. 

While 715 is considered a decent credit score and makes you eligible to purchase your dream car, the interest rates on that loan will still be high. 

But there is a secret hack through which you can reduce your interest rates and here’s how;

Ask your parent or a friend who has a strong credit history and score to stand as a co-signer to your loan. 

Doing so would make you eligible for the same loan at a lower rate. But here’s the catch, if you do not repay the loan EMIs on time, you and your co-signer will be liable to pay the due amounts.

Which will reflect poorly on both of your credit reports by lowering your credit score. 

So if you are looking to catch a co-signer, make sure you pay the due on time, or else you’d have a lot of explaining to do at the dining table.

162,How To Buy A Mercedes !!,"The Indian 🇮🇳 start-up industry is booming, with over 6.5 lakh Indians employed by registered startups in India. 

India is home to the most start-ups in the world, following the United States 🇺🇸 The promise of big salaries and a challenging work environment makes it alluring for many to join startups. 

But the problem is that we aren’t sufficiently equipped to work at a startup. Startups require employees who can work in a dynamic environment and take a hands-on approach to get the job done. 💯

This would mean communicating 🗣️ and working in different fields apart from the one you have expertise. A traditional course does not prepare you for such jobs. They concentrate on getting you specialized in a specific field. 🥲

To tackle this problem, the MESA School Of Business has developed a 12-month on-site program emphasizing practical assignments like building your own business, boot camps, hackathons, and much more. Ensuring you develop the appropriate skills to land a job at your dream startup. 🙌🏻

163,Never Pay THIS Tax !!,"Does your company 🏢 compensate you for unutilized leaves? 

If so, you are in luck. You’ll get a handsome amount paid to you during your F&F settlement. 💰 

However, if you aren’t fully aware of the tax laws, you’ll be paying taxes according to your tax slabs on the leave encashment amount received. 🙃

But there is a way for you to significantly reduce your tax liability through an exemption that not many are aware of. Here’s how it works 👇🏻

➡️ Suppose you got paid leave encashment of INR 10 lakhs when you resigned from the company, you can claim the lowest of the following as an exemption.

A) The amount notified by the government – (recently govt. has increased the amount to INR 25 lakhs)
B) Actual leave encashment received
C) Average monthly salary for the next ten months
D) Daily salary* no. of unutilized leaves (taking a maximum of 30 days per year) for every year of employment. 

⚠️ Note: If you have already claimed leave encashment earlier, the exempted amount is reduced from (A) the amount notified by the government while calculating the exemption for the second time.

165,Dangerous Pension SCAM ! Be Aware  #financewithsharan #shorts,"This past year the government 🇮🇳 gave the option for citizens to increase their monthly pension by making a payment through their PF account. 

But due to poor implementation from the government, scammers used the confusion to scam money from the elderly population. 😔

Just this last month, an elderly woman was scammed by 2 people who promised to increase her monthly pension and asked her to transfer INR 5.5 lakhs to their accounts. 😭

The fraudsters provided her PAN and PF account details to convince her about their genuinity. These details were procured from these victims at an earlier date posed as a government/bank official. 

Scamsters also get details when unsuspecting victims enter their details on malicious websites that collect and store personal information, which is used for future scams. 💀

This is why it’s essential to educate your parents and elders never to send money 💰 through the internet when the payment is asked to be made through a link shared by a banker/government official.

➡️ Share this reel with your family to ensure they don’t fall into such scams.

168,Spouse Wants 50% Of The Wealth,"🚨Disclaimer : The scene is a dramatisation of the movie Wolf Of Wall Street. This is purely for education & entertainment purpose.

Your marriage 💟 can be the most wonderful day of your life, but it can also be the day you signed up for financial ruin. 

Marriages are beautiful but fragile, every couple goes through marital disputes 😢 But sometimes things aren’t meant to be, and suddenly you are stuck paying alimony to your ex-spouse.

Here’s how you can save yourself from an expensive alimony. 

👉🏻 Create an Asset Protection Trust. 

When you create a Family Trust and transfer your assets to the trust, the assets no longer form part of your assets but belong to the trust with you and your family as beneficiaries. 🙌🏻

Since your spouse is not a part of your trust they are not eligible to claim a portion of these assets during a divorce. And since you do not have assets of your own, your liability in terms of alimony is significantly reduced. ⬇️

This is how high-net-worth individuals 💰operate to ensure the safety of their assets through careful estate planning. 

To open a trust, you’ll need to choose a
- trustee
- select beneficiaries
- identify and transfer assets to the trust
- create the trust deed
- and get it registered.

The process of opening a trust is time-consuming and complex. It is best you take appropriate legal advice before trying to open a trust.

We all want to have a trusty dog 🐩 or a cat 🐈 as a companion. That said, have you ever thought of what would happen when they got sick? Or worse, if they went feral and attacked someone.

Anyone who owns a pet knows how expensive it is to own and maintain one, so it is best to take the necessary steps to protect yourself from this risk. 💰 

That’s where PET INSURANCE comes into play, they provide cover against the risk of hospitalization expenses, long-term care, third-party liability cover, etc. 🏥 

You can get your dog insured for as low as INR 1,300. The policy provides an INR 5 lakh cover on third-party liability and INR 65,000 on hospitalization expenses. 💴 

➡️ So the next time you head to the vet, make sure you go by your insurer to get your best friend insured.

Be it Amsterdam, Ibiza or Las Vegas 😉, everyone has a dream destination.

But, it’s important to plan for these trips well in advance, so that you don't go on a spending spree and put a huge dent in your hard-earned savings.

Probably the best way to start preparing for your dream trip is to go for a short-term investment.

Why? With short-term investments, you can enjoy high liquidity and take advantage of changing market conditions. 

By incorporating short-term investments into your overall investment strategy, you can go on your dream trip much sooner than if you kept that money in your bank account. 💰

However, it won’t be wrong to say that there aren’t many options when it comes to short-term investments. Moreover, it is not that easy to pick the right option as well.

This is where ET Money can help you! 

With ET Money Earn you can invest in a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) option where your money is lent out to borrowers with high credit scores. This way you can get up to 11% returns!

Moreover, you can take out your money at any time! 🤑

185,FREE Medical Checkup?,"Tax deductions on preventive health check-ups? 🏥 🩺 

In a recent survey, it was found that around 68% of the urban population in India 🇮🇳 does not get health check-ups. Experts suggest taking a preventive health check-up once every year. 

A preventive health check-up will help identify and diagnose medical conditions at their preliminary stages. Medical conditions can be contained and avoided easier when discovered at the early stage. 🙌🏻

Failure to get yourself diagnosed can cost you big time in terms of health and wealth if you are carrying a disease or condition in its later stages. ❌

To promote preventive health checkups, the government has also extended the deduction under section 80G to these checkups. Any cost incurred up to a maximum of INR 5,000 incurred for you or your spouse & kids can be claimed as a deduction. 💰

You can also claim a further deduction of up to INR 5,000 for any costs relating to preventive health checks you made for your parents. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

So a maximum of IINR 10,000 can be claimed as a deduction which at the highest tax slab saves you INR 3,000. 💴 

It is important to note that the INR 5,000 deduction is covered under the INR 25,000 limit provided under 80G for regular individuals and INR 50,000 for senior citizen parents 🧓🏻👵🏻

➡️ When was the last time you had a checkup done? Tell in the comments below.

188,Why You Should Invest Early,"“The 20s are for fun 🤩 - I’ll invest in my 30s anyways!” 

If that’s your mindset, read ahead 👇🏻

Were you surprised to see the 1st child have a higher net worth than the 2nd child at the end of the reel? 💰

If you were wondering how it’s through the Power of COMPOUNDING 😎

For the first 10 years, boy no.1 chose to invest his INR 50,000 pocket money 💵 at an interest of 12%, earning him approximately INR 1.2 crores but then decided not to invest for the next 20 years. 

While the 2nd boy did the opposite and partied 🕺🏻 for the first 10 years and seriously invested for the next 20 years, finally earning him INR 5 crores. 

➡️ Here’s why the 1st boy earned more money in the end, even though he invested a lesser portion of the money gifted to him.

The answer is TIME !! 🕰️ 

While the 2nd boy was busy partying, the investments made by the first boy kept compounding. By the time the 2nd boy started investing, the 1st boy’s investments were already worth INR 1.2 crores. 💸

So no matter how long the 2nd boy keeps investing INR 50,000 monthly, the gap between them keeps growing even though the 1st boy stopped investing after the first 10 years. 

That’s how powerful compounding is 💪🏻 No wonder Albert Einstein called compounding the 8th wonder of the world 👏🏻

⚠️ Having fun is nice, but keep a portion of your income to invest from day 1 of earning money 🙌🏻

189,Biggest Credit Card Hacks,"You guys have been waiting for my response around the recent Twitter 🕊️ controversy, so here we go ❌

I was put through the wringer regarding my thread on how a credit card 💳 can save you upwards of 10 lakhs 💸

While it may seem preposterous here’s how you do it 👇🏻

Banks 🏦 consider your credit score while sanctioning a loan to you. A bad credit score will get you a loan with a steep interest rate. While someone with a good credit score 😎can get a cheaper loan upwards of 1-1.5% cheaper. 

The easiest way to improve your score and be eligible for cheaper loans would be by developing a good credit history 📖 by repaying credit card bills on time.

➡️ So the next time before you comment on someone else’s work make sure to hear them out 😪

191,"How to NOT PAY TAXES, LEGALLY?","Guysss - In case you buy a home after selling the first one, you can use capital gains tax provisions: Everybody knows that 💁🏻‍♂️

But there is one more way to get the benefit of capital gains tax provisions. Do you know that? I bet you don’t.

Enter 👉 section 54F. 
Suppose this is your first home. 🏡 (54 F is available only if you don’t own any residential property) Value: Rs 1 crore. 😱 But you are confident as you have been saving for this for the last 10 years and have 45 lacs Mutual fund corpus.

You are planning to pay a downpayment amount of 20 lacs by redeeming your mutual fund investments and taking a loan for the remaining amount of 80 lacs. What will you do once you withdraw those 20 lacs from the mutual fund schemes? Pay long-term capital gains? 🔢

No guys, here comes ✨Section 54 F✨ to your rescue. 

This section allows exemption on the long-term capital gains you realize by selling any capital asset other than a residential property if you are buying a residential property. 

Cool right? Just make sure you transfer the proceeds to a capital gains account with a bank if you are not able to utilize the amount right away. 

You can buy the house within this time slot: 
⏳ one year before or two years after the date at which such capital asset is sold.

⏳ In the case of constructing a house, it must complete within 3 years from the sale of such a capital asset.

Also, you must not sell the house for three years.❌ You can’t purchase another house for 1 year  or construct 2nd house within 3 years. ❌ 

So what are waiting for? Get started for your dream home! 🥳

You can thank me later! 👍

192,Plan Your FOREIGN VACATION This Way,"Are you planning on backpacking across Mount Tibidabo along with your special someone? 👩🏻‍❤️‍💋‍👨🏻

Too bad the government increased the TCS from 5% to 20% on foreign tour packages provided by foreign tour operators. Making your trip 15% more expensive. 🤬

From 1st July 2023 onwards, any payment made to a foreign tour operator will be charged an additional 20% 💰 as TCS- Tax Collected at source. 

Say if you spent INR 10 lakhs on a tour package to the sin city, you would be charged INR 12 lakhs (10 +2). The 2 lakhs can be claimed as a refund or reduced from your tax liability when filing your returns. ✔️

So if you plan to travel abroad ✈️ through a foreign tour operator, book your tickets before 1st July 2023. Delaying it will cause you to pay an additional 15% in the form of TCS.

However, suppose your dates do not align, and you must book your vacation post-1st of July - in that case, you can book your flights and accommodation separately through online aggregators to avoid TCS being charged as a foreign tour package 👍🏻

➡️ Another hack you can implement is to book your tour packages closer to the end of the financial year i.e. 31st March. This way, you can claim a refund on the TCS sooner by filing your income tax in the next couple of months.

193,Doctor vs Cricketer ! Who Makes MORE MONEY?,"Time in the market beats timing the market. Even the world’s greatest investor Warren Buffet has stated that trying to time the market is a fool’s errand. 

Why? Well, it’s because equity and gold fluctuate significantly in the short term, making them impossible to predict. So while you are trying to play catch up with the market, you are losing out on possible returns. 

Here are the 3 golden rules you should know before investing;
• Identify your risk tolerance and invest accordingly.
• Be goal-oriented and pick investments accordingly.
• Do an asset allocation between equity, debt, and gold.

However, the average investor often has no time to do this for themselves. 

This is where ET money comes in; they do all of this for you while also sending you monthly alerts on the rebalancing required on your portfolio between all your assets.

199,Buying a PROPERTY for PASSIVE INCOME,"What’s your package, if I may ask? 🫰

Congratulations, if it is more than 16 LAKHS ✨

A recent report by Financial Express says that to be in the top 1%, you need to have a salary upwards of 16 lacs. 💰

With that kind of salary/income, you may want to do some “real” real estate investment other than just reits.

But, rental yields for residential properties are terrible 😔 in most parts of our country. So what to do to earn higher rental yields?

Enter ➡️ Fractional Investment. 

They can return 7-8%. Wanna know more? Read on 👇🏻

If you have more than 25 lacs stacked up for real estate allocation in your portfolio, then you can go for fractional investment in high-end commercial real estate properties. (CREs)

You can get a high monthly rental through premium CRE projects. Unlike REITs, investors have full control over choice of properties. Returns are volatile as of now. Also, these investments are not as liquid as REITs. But the fractional investment market is witnessing high growth in India as offices open up. 🏢🗄️

Considering they have a high potential of value appreciation, they are estimated to provide an IRR of around 12-15%. 

If not now, I hope eventually we’ll reach a phase where we’d afford to have better options than REITs 😊 Thank me at that time!

200,You WILL get SCAMMED through YOUR PANCARD,"Oh, dear Jamtara! You just made a millionaire out of a billionaire - yet again 😣

Yes, Jamtara-style frauds are back again with full force. This time, their target is not just the unsuspecting ordinary people, but celebrities too! 

At the back of their minds, everybody knows they need to link their PAN card with their Aadhar card by 30th June. (Yes, the deadline is moved. So don’t panic!). 

But when a scammer calls and urgently asks “You need to link your PAN card immediately otherwise, your internet banking will get blocked” you are caught off-guard.

And in that moment of weakness you would end up might share details like OTP or CVV through which they steal your money. These kinds of scams are extremely effective against senior citizens. 

To avoid such scams happening to you or your loved ones share this reel with those close to you!

Choices you make in your late teens and early 20s should not define your entire life. If you want to switch your line of work, you should do it before it is too late! 

You’ll need to upskill yourself by taking a course relevant to the occupation. Given the number of online courses available in popular emerging streams like data analytics, the question arises of which you should choose.

Just like how you compare other products, your first step must be to check for reviews and ask your questions to the alumni of the course. 

upGrad allows aspiring learners to enquire about the course with the alumni to see if it meets their requirements and matches their expected job prospects.

You have undergone multiple surgeries 🏥 And exhausted the meager health insurance your company provided. 90% of health insurance companies will not cover you once you have a major surgery like having a stent placed in your heart.

You are losing your health at a drastic pace and running short of money to keep you alive while leaving enough for your family.

Quite the nightmare, don’t you agree? Well, that’s where most of us are headed. But I’m going to teach you how to avoid this nightmare.

-take good care of your mental & physical health, 
-exercise and 
-have adequate health insurance coverage.

204,PROPOSE WITHOUT MONEY!,"Who says size matters, well maybe it does, but not to the extent you are thinking of. 

First, get your mind out of the gutter, and let me explain. 

Diamond engagement rings 💍 are all the rage nowadays, but diamonds are not cheap. Getting a diamond ring for your missus could very well empty your bank. 

Now you can’t bail on your fiance’s request for a diamond ring, but you can get one cheaper than advertised. 🤩

Rather than purchasing a 1-carat diamond ring, get a ring for 0.9 carats instead. The costs of a diamond depend on the 4C’s the cut, clarity, color, and carat. 

The best-looking diamonds have the best cut and clarity, which is what you should be looking for, carat is just the size of the diamond. The naked eye 👁️ can barely pick the difference between a 0.9 and 1-carat diamond, but the difference in cost can be upwards of 30% and more. 

So getting a 0.9 carat can save you a bunch of money while still impressing your fiancé 👩‍❤️‍👨

209,How Banks Are SCAMMING YOU!!!,"You go to a bank 🏦 for home loan. You are somewhat tensed as this is a very big decision. 

You have heard a lot about interest rates rising, and in turn home loan loan EMI or tenure increasing. 😱

The loan official knows what is best for his bank! He is doing this job every single day, so obviously there is information assymetry. 🤨

Sensing your discomfort with EMIs rising in the future, he pitches a fixed rate home loan. 😒 You are told that you need not worry about changing rates as the interest will be charged at a fixed rate for this loan.

You may ask - so what Sharan? If my outgo is fixed, I will have a good night’s sleep. What’s wrong with that?

Well, there are no free lunches! The “fixed” rate may be fixed only for a fixed duration  and may be revised under the “reset” cause in future. Maybe in the event of sharp interest rate hikes or even periodically say once in x years. 🥺

➡️ TL;DR - Please read your terms and conditions while signing off a home loan. Devil 😈 is always in the detail!

If something looks too good to be true, it probably is! 😇

211,How Hospitals Are SCAMMING YOU,"Don’t you get the feeling that there is little difference left between five star hotels 🌟 and the so-called state-of-the-art hospitals?

Both give five star service, and if you are not aware, these hospitals charge a bomb & too, sometimes even double the average cost. 💣 

Yes, you guessed it right. 

The insurance companies don’t like it. * They put a clause called “US” or “usual, reasonable and customary” clause. ❎ 

Meaning, they will only cover the average cost for that kind of procedure in your geographical area.

A difference of 10-20% percentage is fine, but not beyond that. This is why so many claims get settled only partially. ( And it is difficult to fight for the exorbitant cost that the hospital charged you. 🏥 

➡️ So next time you have a planned procedure, make sure to have a rough estimate as to how much such a procedure costs in your area. You can then choose the hospital accordingly !

I’m guilty the same as you are, I used to scour the internet for courses that could rightly upskill me but most courses I found online were trying to deceive me with promises of high-paying jobs on completion. 

The only way we can be confident while purchasing a course is to gauge its effectiveness.

This is why upGrad has developed a new service, talking to their alumni. Not only does upGrad provide quality online courses in collaboration with esteemed domestic and international universities, but owing to this new service, aspiring learners can now enquire about the course with the alumni to see if it meets their requirements and matches the expected job prospects.

216,The Big Mac Index Hota Kya Hai? 🍔,"Have you ever wondered what the cost of an item you consume in India 🇮🇳 would be abroad?

 If you have traveled abroad, you would have noticed that the price of the same goods varies between countries. 

For example, a Big Mac 🍔 costs 5$ approx. in the US, which is equivalent to INR. 400. However, the cost of the same burger in India is just INR. 250. Do the math and you get 1$ coming to just INR 50 INR compared to the INR 80 exchange rate. 

This is because the Big mac is cheaper to produce in India. The cost of rent, salaries etc., are much more affordable in India than in the US 🇺🇸, even though they produce the same burger. 

This is called the Big Mac Index, where the cost of big macs is used to determine the purchasing power parity (PPP).

The PPP compares the value of all goods and services produced between 2 countries and ensures them with one another. By comparing PPP, we can compare income from different countries concerning your spending power. For context, the PPP between the US and India is 1$ = INR 22. 

✅ So the next time you are chowing down on a burger, remember this reel and that you’d have paid more for the same burger somewhere else.

217,Send Money Internationally Without Banks Or Foreign Exchange,"Humans have been using paper for money starting from the early 7th century. But of late, crypto-currencies have seen a rise. 🔐

The government is not a huge fan of crypto due to the lack of regulation, so they made their very own crypto called e-RUPI, and here’s what it means for us. 

An e-RUPI is a digital token equivalent to our fiat currency i.e., the Indian Rupee. ₹₹₹

Since they are digital money, the cost and speed of transactions are vastly reduced, ensuring seamless service over long distances at a cheaper cost 💸

An added advantage of digitizing money is that you can program it to ensure it is utilized only for a given purpose. The government can utilize this feature to ensure that the money goes to the scheme as planned and not elsewhere. However, there is a fear that the government can program the money to monitor the public and control our spending.

You may have to put up with a battery performance that is somewhat reduced. Also, warranty period may be lesser than usual. But those are adjustable things IMHO if I am getting a 30% discount. 🙆‍♂️ What say? 

Caveat: You can only do this when the new models are out. For example for Apple you can go during April and September to ask for display pieces of the previous models.

220,Which Tax Regime Is Suitable For You?,"The government finally amended the Income Tax rates 🎉

Unfortunately for us it’s from the New Tax regime. And to double down, they have made the New Tax regime the default option while paying your tax. 🥲

Does that mean it’s time we migrate to the new regime? 🫠

Not so fast - it depends on the deductions & exemptions you qualify for under the Old Tax regime. If you earn more than 15 lakhs💰, you would have to qualify for at least INR 4.25 lakhs of exemptions and deductions to pay the same tax you would under the New Tax regime. 💴

221,Fixed Deposit In Small Finance Bank,"There is nothing as bad as missing your dream vacation 🏝️trip due to less-than-average stock or MF returns. 

Just imagine your family giving you a “dodo” look just because your disciplined SIP investment over the last year didn’t hit 🎯 the right number at right time. 

Enter ➡️ A smart Short Term goals strategy.

No-no: I am strictly against get-rich-quick and “21 din me Paisa double” sort of schemes. 

Instead, I want you to know about small finance banks’ savings accounts. 

When your goal is less than a year away, you can’t expose yourself to the market tantrums. Basically, what you need to focus on is a secure, decent return generating asset. 

In the current scenario, small finance banks’ savings accounts are one such asset. Their returns even beat the liquid funds today. So it makes more sense to use savings accounts, divide your corpus amongst them and get assured 6.5-7% returns. 

This ensures safety of your capital while providing similar returns to a traditional bank’s 1/1.5-year FD. Plus your money is not locked in and you can withdraw it as and when you plan the trip without any penalty! 

So what are you waiting for? Start planning right away!

224,Understand This To Get iPhone For FREE !!,"Are you still picking mutual funds seeing last year’s CAGR? 🤔

Well sorry to inform you but you have just invested in a fund without any proper research and can possibly not make the returns you had hoped for. 

CAGR calculates the return made from the starting point to the end, now 15% CAGR sounds appealing but between those two points the fund could have tanked and recovered. 

This means the fund you invested might not perform to the returns you were expecting 🥲

Instead, you should look at 👉🏻 Rolling Returns. Rolling returns compute the CAGR at different points and take an average of them. This will then take into consideration the fluctuations in the fund’s value making it a much more reliable figure.

But Sharan, where should I invest? 

I can’t tell you where to invest but I can teach you how to pick the best mutual funds. 

After discussing with many fund managers and financial advisors I built excel tools to help pick the right mutual fund for you 😎

Just this month an INR 300 crore fraud ring run by 15 Chinese loan lending Apps was busted in Uttarakhand.
 
Do not be allured by the promises of interest-free loans found across the web unless you don’t mind your very own rule 34-based pictures and videos being distributed to all your contacts. Once scammed the likelihood of getting your money back is unlikely. 

So don’t let yourself be scammed, here are a few pointers you should look out for while installing any loan apps:
👉🏻 Check if the loan app is affiliated with an NBFC/Bank registered under the RBI. If not avoid them like the plague.
👉🏻 Verify at the NBFCs website linked to the loan app on whether the app is truly affiliated with them.
👉🏻 If the app does not do a KYC and approves you for a loan with minimal verification rest assured you are being scammed and promptly delete the app.
👉🏻 Don’t go agreeing to all the permissions in a hurry while setting up the app. Do not ever permit such apps to access your contacts or gallery.

Indians 🇮🇳 are some of the most overworked people in the world leading to increased stress. One way you could destress yourself is by relieving yourself. 

Unfortunately, Indians have many misconceptions about the process and avoid doing the need thinking it is harmful to us. 

According to a study 📚 done by the National Center for Biotechnology Information, only 46% of men and 20% of women in India have a healthy knowledge of masturbation. However, sex-ed is essential for us to know which is why The Sex Book written by Leeza Mangaldas is a great start to help put your sex doubts to bed.

You could also take a vacation 🏖️ every once in a while to destress yourself while saving a bunch in taxes. 

Domestic travel expenses ✈️ can be claimed as a deduction under LTA twice in a block of 4 years for you and your family. 

If you and your partner are smart about your utilization you can claim LTA for all 4 years. You can claim for 2 years while your partner claims for the other 2 years. Effectively covering all 4 years in a block 💯

Taking a home loan is stressful enough on its own but banks go out of their way to make it even harder. Most banks require you to have life insurance to take a home loan since the risk of non-payment due to death.

If you are someone without a life insurance policy, they will try to have you purchase one through them by offering discounts on premiums and also offering to add it to your home loan.

However, these premiums that are added to your home loan are charged with interest on top of them making them more expensive in the long run. 

Don’t be blinded by discounts and rather get a term insurance online where the premiums would be much cheaper when compared to taking it through the bank.",2023-01-11,1232932,67680,191,uZE1thz3hqY

You could take a Personal Loan but they charge interest ranging from 12% and higher 🤯

Rather I would suggest taking a top-up on your home loan instead.  ⬆️

If you have paid 12 or more installments of your home loan EMI, you become eligible to take a top-up home loan, the interest charged under these loans is only 1% higher than your pre-existing home loan - making them some of the cheapest loans available in the market. 

To make things sweeter, when a top-up loan is used for the renovation, repairs, or reconstruction of your property you can claim up to INR 30,000 of the interest paid as a tax deduction💰 

Most banks 🏦 allow you to take a top-up loan to meet any personal purpose making them a better alternative to a personal loan.

234,Find Out Your Personal Inflation Rate? #financewithsharan #investingforbeginners #personalfinance,"Inflation can be a menace which is why we take into consideration inflation of 6%-7% while making financial decisions. 📉

Unfortunately, your true inflation is different from the one government proposes. 🥲

We all experience inflation differently, the rate of inflation depends on the goods and services we consume. The government 💼makes assumptions based on the average Indian’s spending habits however, you may not fall within those assumptions. 

👉🏻 For eg, the government assumes you spend only 2% of your monthly expenditure on recreational activities while you may be partying it up on the daily. This is why it’s important to calculate your actual inflation rate 💯

➡️ To help you calculate your true inflation rate I have prepared a tool, which you can download from the link in my pinned comment. 

⚠️Important note: Make sure to download the excel file and not open it through google sheets.

235,Secret Hack To Maximise Your Current 80C Limit.,"There are rumours of the 80C limit being expanded to INR 2.5 lakhs in the upcoming finance bill. 🫡

But did you know of this secret hack to maximize your current 80C limit❓

- You can first claim 80C up to INR 1.5 lakhs through tax saving instruments like ELSS, NPS and PPF. 
- After exhausting the limit you can claim a further INR 50,000 under 80 CCD (1B). 
- You can also ask your employer to contribute up to 10% of your salary into NPS under 80 CCD (2) in our case being an additional INR 50,000. 

✨Bringing your total deduction to INR 2.5 lakhs✨

NPS invests in market linked securities hence they also provide better returns than PPF and bank deposits. 

Here’s how you can get started 👇🏻

You can invest in NPS through ET money. It’s fast and paperless and gives an instant tax proof which you’ll need to claim the deduction. ET money also allows you to set up an SIP to invest monthly.

236,Who Gets Your Parents’ Assets? #financewithsharan #investingforbeginners #personalfinance,"Transferring assets to an HUF activates clubbing provisions, meaning any income 💰generated by the HUF is taxed in your name which defeats the whole point of making an HUF. 

However, there is a way for you to transfer assets to your HUF without worrying about clubbing provisions and that is when the transfer is done through a - Will 📄

There are no taxes levied on inheritance by way of will ❌

By transferring assets to your HUF by way of will, any income generated will be taxed in the hands of the HUF as per the slab rates, which makes the first INR 2.5 lakhs is ✨TAX FREE✨. The HUF can also make tax saving investments to reduce their tax liability.

238,Earn FREE Bitcoins,"Stop me if you have done this ⚠️

You apply for a new credit card, excited to win some rewards, and after painstakingly amassing enough reward points you end up forgetting to encash them leading to their expiry. Or, you amass a lot of points that eventually turn out to be of no real utility value. 

Of course, you could go for a credit card with a money-back policy, but where’s the fun in that?

This is why the people at GoSats have come up with a rewards platform linked to Bitcoin that makes payments fun again!

For every transaction you make you get 2% as money back in the form of SATS (Smallest Denomination of Bitcoin). 

🎉You can also win up to one whole Bitcoin by trying out their lucky spin wheel. 

The best part: No restrictions such as expiry dates on these rewards. 🤩

You can register now and earn Bitcoin on your transactions while the market is still down and sell them for a profit when the crypto market recovers.

239,Season 2022 Comes To An End ❤️,"What a crazy year 2022 has been. Literally ☺️

I remember thinking at the end of 2021 that life can’t get more crazier and better than this, but here I am at 2022 feeling the exact same way. 

But what happened behind the scenes of “Kya phook ke aya hai be?”

As I look back I think about my lows:
- miscalculated career move 
- heartbreak
- giving up on Columbia MBA
- extreme loneliness & missing my parents back home 

Every one of these lows had the potential to make me give up everything and become a hippie. But fate had some other plans. 

These were my highs:
- moving to the city of dreams, Mumbai 🇮🇳 
- building a ‘home’ in my rented apartment 
- My team growing from 2 to 15
- 3 international work trips 
- doubling down on content creation & starting my business and achieving financial independence

Just goes to show that life is truly a balance of both highs and lows. Without the lows the highs will never come. You are always defined by what you do when you face adversity.

Last but not the least..as always I have you guys to thank. You literally make everything in my life better and I’m so grateful for y’all ❤️

240,Save Money For Your Kids Education The Right Way,"Parents always want the best for their children but they don’t go about it in the best way possible. 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦

Case in point - products such as child insurance are still being bought today. 

Parents are drawn to the allure of an insurance cum investment product without realizing they do not meet their child’s future needs ❌

While the product may sound great in concept, the insurance coverage is small, the return from premiums is unimpressive and oftentimes doesn’t even beat inflation 🥲

And with education inflation 📚 being as high as 12%-14% at prestigious colleges and universities, you would fall short in funds to meet your child’s higher education expenses.

Rather, you can add-on to your existing Life Insurance to safeguard your child’s future and invest systematically to meet his future expenses and needs after considering the appropriate education inflation 💯

243,Clear Your Credit Card Bills On Time ft. @AmyAelaOfficial,"Sharan may have had his heart broken 💔 but you can save yourself from financial heartbreaks by paying your credit card dues on time.

Late payment of credit card dues brings both penalty and interest charges where the interest rates can be as high as 42% per annum, not to mention a drop in your credit score ⬇️

Since the impact of non-payment of credit card dues on time is too large, the RBI has required all banks to give an additional 3 days after the bill due date to pay your credit card dues. So, if you haven’t automated your credit card payments, make sure to pay within 3 days of the bill being due.

245,Take Your Credit Score To The High 800s,"The biggest black hole when it comes to personal finance is arguably how credit scores work. 

Your credit score is more important than the number of followers on your Instagram. Why? 

Coz it can literally save you lakhs of rupees when you apply for home loan, car loan, personal loan etc. Forget saving money - You could be outright rejected by major banks if your credit score is poor.

Unfortunately, nobody taught us this in schools. I remember when I got my first credit card. I was fortunately in the company of IIM grads who knew how credit cards worked in and out. Over the years, I’ve spoken to several credit risk analysts both in my corporate job and as a content creator to learn more about how credit scoring is done.

Here is what you need to do to keep your credit score sexy af:
1) Keep utilisation low
2) Check how many enquiries are being made in your name
3) If you don’t recognise something, immediately report it to the bureaus
4) Make payments on time

You need to do this with multiple bureaus to ensure your credit score is high across the board. Obviously, this is not easy and requires a lot of patience and grunt work. 

I’m proud to introduce you guys to OneScore to solve this problem once and for all. This is a completely free to use platform which:
1) Sends you monthly credit reports to help you be informed about what is going in with your credit score
2) It gives you actionable insights on what to do if your credit score is low
3) Keeps you informed about any frauds that are happening with your accounts.

If you’re someone who cares about your credit score to get lower interest rates form banks then this is a no brainer.

246,Save Your Self From Tax Penalties!,"Your employer pays TDS on your salaried income but what about other income like rental income, interest, and capital gains? 

Well, the government expects you to pay for it quarterly as advance tax. 
 
The number of advance taxpayers has been consistently increasing year on year, but not many of us end up depositing taxes on time and end up paying interest charges of 1%  per month until we pay taxes and file our tax returns. 
 
With Kotak payment gateway you can seamlessly pay your income tax even if you don’t have a Kotak account, while choosing from a wide range of payment modes such as Credit Cards, Debit Cards, Internet Banking, UPI, and even International Credit Cards.

247,Credit Card Hard Enquiries,"Recent surveys have shown that around 50% of Indians do not know what affects their credit score. And some of your bad credit habits are making loans more expensive for you and one such offender is making too many hard inquiries with credit-giving institutions.

Every time you make a hard inquiry the bank checks your creditworthiness to know if you can pay back the loan. 

Another parameter they check is the total number of hard inquiries made by a person this helps the bank ascertain how credit hungry you are, the hungrier you are the lower your credit score drops. 

This is why if you are shopping the market for a loan or credit card do so within 14 days since all the inquiries made in those 14 days are taken as 1 hard inquiry, if you continue to make more inquiries post this period each hard inquiry made will lower your credit score.

248,How To Plan Your Finances?,"“I wish I had learnt all this in school. I would have saved so much money” said a student when I introduced them to the F.I.R.E Concepts - a highlight of my Signature Masterclass. 

You see, most of us make the mistake of :
👉🏻 Either not even thinking about how to plan our finances. 
OR
👉🏻 Planning our financial goals as per societal standards and blindly copying friends. 

But the F.I.R.E Strategy helps you decide what your money figure is. Something which most people don’t even know.

Personally, I recommend you go for the 4% Rule. What is it?

➡️ Your Annual Expense x 25. 

As per research conducted by Trinity college in Dublin, this amount can last you for 30-40 years of retirement, comfortably.

But that’s just 1 piece of the puzzle. The internet is filled with these kinds of money rules but nobody talks about how to achieve them. 

👉🏻 For example, a rule might say you need 4 Crores to retire. But..

1) How to get to 4 Crores? 
2) How to pick the mutual funds?
3) How to divide your money among equity, debt, gold, crypto and real estate. 
4) How to pick health and life insurance? 

These are exactly what I’ll be discussing in my upcoming Masterclass this Sunday, 11th December at 6PM ⏰ 

You will learn the science of personal finance in this class, and make smart financial choices with a peace of mind and achieve financial freedom so that you can spend more time on things you really love. 

As a bonus, I will also be sharing some of my proprietary tools such as 
1) Home Rent vs buy calculators
2) Index fund selector
3) Should you pre-pay loan calculator?
4) FD vs debt fund selector and many more... 

These are the most accurate and comprehensive tools on the internet. If you find or build a more accurate one, I will refund your money and hire you 😇

There’s a reason over 17,437+ people have attended it already.

249,Mutual Fund Investing Made Easy,"Are you guilty of investing in mutual funds by blindly looking at last year’s returns? 

I was one of them. I used to read articles on the best-performing mutual funds of the previous year and blindly invest in them. I now realise that there are several parameters that we need to look at before selecting a mutual fund, such as AUM, expense ratio, performance quality, downside protection etc. 

Now deciphering from the fund fact sheet can be a cumbersome task. Hence, it’s no wonder that managing and growing your money is a herculean task for most of us. We simply don’t want to do it coz we feel stressed or would love to give it to a professional SEBI-registered financial planner. 

Sadly, there are only 1,300 of them are in India, and they don’t come cheap. These guys recommend regular mutual funds to you, which results in Crores in extra charges for you over a 40-year period. 

➡️ Solution: Wealth-tech platforms have built some mind-blowing features in the past 2 years, which have made investing simple even for the common man who doesn’t want to break his/her head with managing and growing money. 

In my opinion, ET Money is one of the best platforms for evaluating the detailed fund report card for every mutual fund. Having this information at the tip of your fingers helps you make better decisions. ET Money also does regular health check of your portfolio to help you avoid costly mistakes in case you’re too busy not to do it yourself. Finally, if you don’t want to do any of the research, they also help with recommending suitable mutual fund portfolios for you according to your risk profile for a small fee.

Whatever category of investor you belong to having reliable mutual fund information and an advisory platform has become super important today.

250,Investing For Child’s Education,"As a parent, you always want the best for your child but with mounting education inflation, FDs are not gonna cut it as an investment for your child’s future. 

My suggestion - you’ll need to systematically invest your money to maximize your returns. 20% in PPF for tax-free guaranteed returns and the rest 80% in mutual funds (40% index fund, 40% midcap funds, 20% small cap funds) to generate surplus returns.

How do I know all of this❓

Well, I speak to many Industry specialists, CAs, wealth managers, and CFAs on the daily to learn all the hidden secrets of finance. 

👉🏻 And I’ve added that along with years of my personal research to come up with a kickass course that will cover everything from 
- Financial & asset planning
- Mutual fund selection
- Insurance 
- Tax planning

251,Buying House For Marriage? Watch This.,"A recent survey done by the National Real Estate Development Council showed that 50% of the Indian population still preferred to Invest in real estate while 21% invested in equity, 16% in fixed deposits, and 15% in gold. 

While it’s evident Indians still prefer real estate what one needs to know is that rental yield in India is only 2-3% of the value of the house, which is taxed at slab rates making them tax-inefficient. 

But what about the capital appreciation Sharan you may ask? Capital appreciation in India has been around 5-7% depending on the area while not bad it hardly compares to the returns equity draws in. 

And if you are still not convinced know that real estate just like equity fluctuates in value depending on the economic conditions of our country. Real estate was down by around 40-50% in 2008 owing to the global financial crisis. 

Still hungry to buy that house?

252,Zero Cost Term Insurance Policy,"Indians don’t want to pay for something which protects them when shit hits the fan. That’s why insurance is so under-penetrated in India. 

To address this, insurance companies have launched something called ✨Zero cost term insurance✨

This is a new policy which returns all your money back even if you don’t die. The main catch is that you have to purchase a 35-year policy. Usually term insurance is required until you’re 60. 

For example, in my case, I’m 27. If I purchase a policy which ends at 60, that’s 33 years from now. I will not be eligible for zero-cost. Hence I need to extend the policy term by another 2 years to be eligible for Zero-cost. The premium cost will increase by 10% but the opportunity cost of that increased premium cannot beat getting all the money back. 

➡️ To get access to this tool which helps comparing insurance policies then you need to subscribe to the One Percent Finance Club (Link in bio)

If you haven’t purchased a term insurance before then you can consider this. But if you’re someone who feels like you will achieve financial independence in less than 30 years then you don’t need this because zero cost term insurance allows you to get all the money back only after crossing 30 years or 60 age whichever is earlier.

If you’re not - Kya Phook ke aya hai be?

Now if you want more tax savings here is what you do:

1) Ask the HR to restructure your salary and contribute either ₹50,000 or 10% of your basic salary (whichever is lower) to NPS account. 

2) You also contribute the same amount from your in hand salary. 

Congratulations you just saved ₹30,000 in taxes.

Don’t go overboard with NPS beyond the tax savings. In my yesterday’s I spoke about why NPS is a bad investment for your retirement planning. But for tax saving purpose it’s still quite good.

254,How To Get 16.8% Returns.,"Recency bias is severely impacting our investing decisions today. High inflation, US market woes and UK instability have made most of us believe that the end is here. 

I know of many people who are pulling out all their money from stock market to invest in FDs of 3-4 year lock in. The 7.5% FD interest rates have made it very appealing for them to jump ship. 

What are they essentially doing?

They are trying to time the market. They are hoping that the markets will go down further so that they can buy it back again at lower prices. Now, if you’re a hardcore investor who understands market cycles, reads financial news everyday, get access to privy government policies before they become public, access to company CEOs outlook on their business which they would never publicly reveal then you can make a lot of money.

Doesn’t sound like you? Don’t worry. Even Warren Buffett doesn’t think normal investors should time the market. So what’s more important?

According to research, 90% of your investing performance is driven by how well you divide your money across equity, debt, gold etc. In the financial world this is called “asset allocation”

Now what is the ideal asset allocation? How to pick the index funds within the respective asset classes? How and when to move your money around depending on changing market conditions? Does this sound like a lot of work?

Well, it is. It requires regular assessment of your portfolio. Sounds boring? Allow me to introduce @etmoney_official Genius. This is first of its kind app which has actually revolutionised the art in investing effectively to get you superior returns. It removes all the guess work and grunt work from your hands. All you need to do it is follow the recommendations they send every month. It takes like 1 second!

255,Secret Way To Save Tax !,"FD interest rates are so high right now that people have dumped the stock market. At 7-8% interest rates I can understand why.

The only problem is that the way FDs are taxed it severely impacts the compounding effect. Meaning, if your profit in FD in a given year exceeds ₹40,000 then tax is deducted at 10%. This is deducted on a yearly basis irrespective of whether it’s a 2 or 5 year FD.

How to avoid?

I’m assuming everyone here makes more than 2.5L per annum. So submitting form 15G/ Form 15H is of no use to you.

The only hack left is to divide your FD in multiple banks. Don’t keep more than 6L in a single FD. Why? Because at 7% interest rate that comes to ₹42,000 profit so ₹4,200 tax will be deducted. Instead divide the 6L into 2 banks.

7% interest on ₹3L is only ₹21,000 profit which is below the tax limit and hence no tax will be deducted.

👉🏻 Note: You still have to pay the who tax as per income slab filing taxes. But then you can pay from your savings account instead of it being deducted from FD since it has higher interest rate.

256,Car Buying Hacks - Part 1,"Kia Seltos is one of the most popular cars in the last 3 years. 

The company has sold more than 5 lakh cars with 60% coming from Seltos. My dad bought the middle variant 2 years back for around 16L. Very soon the whole city of Mangalore was filled with these cars. 

Now the manufacturer wants to sell the new model to make more money. 

Have you ever wondered what happens to the test drive cars then? They go on sale at a bargain price. 

If you’re low on budget when buying a brand new car just wait for 6 months. The test drive cars will be on sale. 

Three things to remember:

1) The dealer will try to pass it on as a mildly driven first hand car. Never fall far that. Always treat it like a 2nd hand car. 

2) Do not pay as per the age of the car. Pay as per the kilometers driven. Deduct 1.5 to 2% of the car’s value for every 1000 kms driven. 

3) Ask for extended warranty and to fix the dents and scratches if any. 

The dealers are very open to negotiation coz they want to get rid of it asap. All test drive cars are not great for purchase. The more number of drivers who test the car the more the clutch gets damaged. Prefer automatic cars when buying test drive cars. Also brake pads would be damaged a lot. Check that out and ask the dealer to refurbish it.

Have you bought a test drive car before? Let me know your experience below ⬇️

257,How Banks Scam You.,"7-8% FD rates have been the talk of the town. FDs are once again back in style owing to the rising interest rates. RBI is being forced to increase it to bring down our inflation. But a consequence of this is higher loan interest rates.

Most people think that home loan interest rates are fixed for the entire 20-30 years. Many reputed publications and influencers were encouraging people to get home loans while they were low. Well, guess it what it doesn’t work like that. Since home loan is a super long loan running decades banks keep it floating. Meaning they change every year depending on RBI rates.

Back in 2020, home loan interest rates were at 6.5%. Now it’s touching 8%. Banks have 2 options. Either increase your EMI or increase the tenure. For a 1 Cr home, the EMI would increase form INR 74,000 to INR INR 83,000. Obviously this requires calling up all the customers and asking them to pay more. The easier option for banks is to simply increase the tenure so that you never realise the pinch.

This is what is happening. What can you do?

Now that you’re aware of this, you can call up the bank and renegotiate the interest rates with them or threaten to transfer to another bank. Banks will comply coz it costs way more to acquire a new customer.

Try to pay the increased EMI instead of increasing the tenure because the interest rates are on the higher end now. You might not get additional tax benefits for the increased EMI since you have already breached the 2L exemption.

258,Don’t Invest Your Money Here,"How great would it be if you received 50,000 pm until you die. That's what the NPS (National Pension scheme) tries to solve. 

Not 50k per month precisely, it of course depends on how much you've contributed to NPS. It could be 15k per month or even 1 lakh per month. 

What's the problem?

I personally think NPS investments are not done in the right way. They have nailed the equity allocation - by allowing upto 75% until the age of 50 and then gradually reduces to 50% until 60. This is in line with the Equity Glide Path method which I have talked about in a previous reel. However, within equity the allocation is highly skewed towards large cap stocks - 90%+ 

When your retirement goal is more than 30-40 years away, it's not wise to invest 90% in large cap. Having atleast 40% allocation to midcap and another 15-20% in small cap can drastically increase your returns by 4-5% CAGR. Over a 30 year period this difference is massive.

Having said this, investing in NPS still makes sense for tax saving purposes especially if you're in the 30% income bracket. You can ask your employer to structure your salary in such a way that your employer matches your contribution to NPS. It is also possible to get upto 3.5L in tax exemption if use NPS properly. That like 1 lakh in tax saved every year. I will make a separate reel on this topic. Don't worry 🙂

But beyond that do not invest in NPS and consider actively managed mutual fund.

259,Hack When Buying New Car. Explaining Transfer Of No Claim Bonus In Simple Words.,"So you just bought a new car or are planning to change your car. You’ve been using your current car for almost 6 years now without ever getting into an accident or damaging your car. Kudos to your driving skills.

Now guess what? You can use this fact to get 50% discount on your new car insurance as well. Why? Coz insurance companies love people who don’t make any claims. As a reward they give you discounts on your own damage cover.

Caveat: You get a 50% only if you insurance cost of the new car is the same as that of the old car. If you’re currently driving an i10 and then shift to an Audi Q7 obviously, they won’t give you a 50% discount on the Audi Q7 car insurance. 

The discount is only on the own damage cover and not for third-party insurance.

How to get it?

Just get call up your current insurer and ask them to give you a NCB retention letter within 90 days of the sale of the old car. You can use this for upto 3 years. If you’re changing your insurance company then also get a NCB transfer letter.

If you’re buy the insurance online on platforms such as PolicyBazaar, Insurance dekho etc, you can choose the NCB discount that you’re eligible for before making the payment.

➡️ Do not forget to do this! It’s easy savings of a few thousand rupees. Have you used this before. Please comment below 👇🏻

260,House Split In Divorce,"Half of the marriages in the USA 🇺🇸 end up in divorce. 

You could argue that India 🇮🇳 is more family-oriented, has better culture and what not..the data shows that divorce has increased 50-60% in India especially in urban cities. 

Women have become increasingly independent in the past few decades and are no longer obligated to stay in an unhappy marriage. This is a good thing.

But divorces can make your finances messy. Especially if you are the richer among the 2. 

Imagine this, you bought a new house with your spouse under joint ownership. You contribute 75% of the EMI and 90% of the down payment coz you are well off. But 2 years later your spouse doesn’t love you coz the “feel” isn’t there anymore and files for divorce.

How much of the house do you think you can get?

75%? 90%? 

Wrong!!

In the eyes of the law, joint ownership means 50-50. It doesn’t matter if your spouse didn’t contribute a single rupee to the EMIs. You lose 50%. That’s why they say marriage is the quickest way to cut your wealth by half. 

How to avoid?

Prenups are illegal in India so that’s not an option. 

You could mention in the property agreement exactly how much of the house you own based on the contribution. If you don’t mention that then the law assumes the default i.e. 50-50

You might say “Sharan how dare you talk about divorce and splitting of properties even in a committed relationship”. Well, that’s a conversation for another day. Until then, you can ask your divorced future self to thank me incase sh!t hits the fan :)

261,Join Me In My Diwali Celebration !,"“I wish I had learnt all this in school. I would have saved so much money” said a student when I introduced them to the F.I.R.E Concepts - a highlight of my Signature Masterclass. 

You see, most of us make the mistake of :
👉🏻 Either not even thinking about how to plan our finances. 
OR
👉🏻 Planning our financial goals as per societal standards and blindly copying friends. 

But the F.I.R.E Strategy helps you decide what your money figure is. Something which most people don’t even know.

Personally, I recommend you go for the 4% Rule. What is it?

➡️ Your Annual Expense x 25. 

As per research conducted by Trinity college in Dublin, this amount can last you for 30-40 years of retirement, comfortably.

But that’s just 1 piece of the puzzle. The internet is filled with these kinds of money rules but nobody talks about how to achieve them. 

👉🏻 For example, a rule might say you need 4 Crores to retire. But..

1) How to get to 4 Crores? 
2) How to pick the mutual funds?
3) How to divide your money among equity, debt, gold, crypto and real estate. 
4) How to pick health and life insurance? 

These are exactly what I’ll be discussing in my upcoming Masterclass this Sunday, 30th October at 6PM ⏰ 

You will learn the science of personal finance in this class, and make smart financial choices with a peace of mind and achieve financial freedom so that you can spend more time on things you really love. 

As a bonus, I will also be sharing some of my proprietary tools such as 
1) Home Rent vs buy calculators
2) Index fund selector
3) Should you pre-pay loan calculator?
4) FD vs debt fund selector and many more... 

These are the most accurate and comprehensive tools on the internet. If you find or build a more accurate one, I will refund your money and hire you 😇

There’s a reason over 10500+ people have attended it already.

262,Save lakhs through credit cards !!,"I just came home for Diwali. While at the airport, I was pitched a credit card by an Axis Bank representative. It's the one which is co-branded with Vistara. You basically get a free business class flight ticket which usually costs INR 40,000+, priority check-in, 10kg extra baggage and a bunch of other benefits. Basically, the more you spend the more free flights you can redeem.

Now being a middle-class guy, I always wanted to travel business class but couldn't afford it. The only hurdle is the INR 10,000 joining fees. The hack is that I can get it waived off if I spend INR 1.2 lakhs in 90 days. Now I spend close to 50-60k per month so this shouldn't have been a problem. But 50% of the spend goes to rent.

If only I could pay rent using credit card.. Well now you can!! CRED the darling fin-tech of India has enabled us to pay rent, maintenance, electricity bill, internet bill, water bill, education fees, security deposit, brokerage, loan repayment and a lot more using a credit card. Now it's super easy for me to get fee waiver. Also, I can easily spend close 5-6lakhs on my credit card. The more I spend on my credit card the more free flight tickets I get. I never have to pay for flights again if I plan it properly.


Please note: Only on certain credit cards and upto 25% cash back on all bill payments

263,Advantages Of Target Maturity Debt Funds,"Indians🇮🇳 love predictability. That’s why FDs rule the average Indian’s investment portfolio.

Even if you tell investors that FDs are unable to beat inflation they still happily invest. Why? Because they know that come what may - their investment will see a positive growth.

But as you already know, FDs give shit returns in the long term due to high taxation. Debt funds are an alternative but have no predictability of returns like FDs. For example right now - Since the RBI has been increasing interest rates, debt funds have seen temporary losses. Higher the average maturity of the debt fund, higher is the losses. This doesn’t happen with FDs. 

➡️ Solution?

Target Maturity Debt Funds. 

This a new breed of debt fund which invest in bonds with a target year in mind. 

For eg, say you want to buy a home in 2026, you can invest in a target maturity debt fund maturing in 2026. When you finally need the money in 2026, any changes in interest rates by RBI will not significantly impact your investment because there is only a few months left for the bonds to mature. 

Lower the maturity lower the impact. Whereas in normal debt funds, the average maturity would still be high resulting in higher losses.

264,Watch This To Save Money On Car Loans,"Vehicle loans are expensive but should you be prepaying them? 

Common Indian sentiment is that loans are bad so prepay them as soon as possible. But that needn’t always be the right decision. 

Certain vehicle loans give us tax benefits like EV loans, you can claim up to Rs 1,50,000 of interest as a deduction under section 80EEB. This brings down the effective interest rate of the loan, making it much cheaper than what’s shown in its face value. 

Business owners and self-employed who purchase a vehicle for their business and profession can claim the entire interest on the loan as an expense against their total income. Making it very lucrative to take long-term loans. 

Another added benefit to buying a car for business purposes is that you can claim income tax depreciation on the vehicle. Essentially claiming 15% (40% for EVs) of the value of the car against your income as an expense. However, this will not affect your effective interest rates.

P.S. I’d rather not take a vehicle loan, just take a cab everyday and invest the cash you would have invested on a car.

267,Retire In Your 40s,"Most of us will be dependent on our kids to take care of us in retirement. 

Don’t believe me?

In the US 🇺🇸 only 4% of people become financially independent by the time they turn 60. Imagine India 🇮🇳 where the wealth inequality is even worse. 

Why does this happen? 

Most of us don’t take retirement seriously. We are all “going with the flow” or we think achieving financial independence is next to impossible. 

Let me bust this myth once and for all.

👉🏻 Step 1: Figure out the target number. 100 Crores??? Kya phook ke aya be? Most of us think such high numbers coz we imagine the cash lying under our mattress doing nothing. We will be investing it bro.
Let’s say you spend ₹50k per month. 6 lakhs a year. If you want to attain retirement at 49. Inflation adjusted expense 19.35 lakhs a year. Money you need in your bank while watching Netflix all day: ₹5.8 Cr

👉🏻 Step 2: Start an SIP towards this. If you assume 10% returns you need ₹48,000 SIP. 

Now I know. You can’t invest so much. But your future self can. Let’s assume you invest 10% more every year. 

Now all you need is ₹20,000 SIP. 

Still too much? Start now and increase drastically later when you earn more.

269,Watch This If You Want To Retire Early,"Early retirement has now taken the world by storm. Youngsters are now unwilling to remain shackled to 9-5 jobs until 60. Quiet quitting, moonlighting, the Great Resignation is all proofs of this trend. 

Sure! working a job that you genuinely love until 60 is great. But all of us are not that lucky. A recent poll that I conducted among 60,000+ respondents revealed that less than 10% of you love your job. 

Even if you love your job, we humans get bored easily and would like to explore other things which might not be well paying but still give us joy. Having the freedom to explore this is what early retirement is all about. 

Now the scientific way to achieve this is called FIRE. Meaning if I spend 12 lakhs a year, I need 25 times this amount to call myself sorted financially. 

So if you have 3 Crores today then congratulations ! You can live the next 30-40 years in your bed watching Netflix all day and spend 1 lakh a month.

But most of us take forever to achieve a Crore+ networth. What if you want to achieve it faster and be okay with working a relaxed job? 

👉🏻 Enter Coast FIRE. 

Achieving this number allows you to quit your stressful jobs and explore other opportunities which pay you enough to support your lifestyle, while the Coast FIRE number keeps growing to achieve FIRE when you're 60.

I teach how to do this in the One Percent Finance Club.

270,Blockchain Network For Voting Purpose? Check Out How.,"Blockchain will revolutionize how you vote 🗳 

What if I told you that you could vote from home without the fear of any mismanagement or fraud?

You'd be like kya phook kya be, but the change is inevitable. Last general election voter turnout was a record high 67%, which is the highest ever. With newer technologies, criminal activities like vote tampering and ballot box looting will become nonexistent.

One such technology that is yet to be implemented is ✨Blockchain Technology✨

Under the blockchain, users would be able to vote for their candidate and their vote data will be handled by the rest of the nodes in the blockchain. To make any changes in the block, one would have to hack into more than half the nodes in the system which would be highly impractical. 

This would stop candidates from being able to bully voters, tamper with the vote count, steal the ballot box, and other malicious practices. 

The application of such a system may not be practical currently due to high energy and technological requirements. However, in the following years with new innovations in the field, we'll be able to see it in action.

272,Don’t Buy A House ft. @rajshamani,"Don’t let the broker fool you, make the correct decision! 

I’ve always stayed on rent, something I’ve heard time and time again is why not just pay a little bit extra monthly and buy a house on EMI. Home loans are the cheapest loans you can get and they come with a slew of tax benefits. But what India fails to see is that your house keeps a significant portion of your wealth locked up.

Suppose you plan to buy a house worth 1 crore rupees, the rental yield is going to be 2-4% which gives a rental yield of 1.2 crores over a 20-year period. But this same 1 Crore invested for a return of just 10% you’d have made a return of over 5.7 crores in a period of 20 years. 

And for those wondering what about the capital appreciation of the asset, India has shown a 6% capital appreciation for real estate. But this is affected by a lot of factors that are not within our hands, if you can find a home with a good capital appreciation your house can be a good investment. But the average Indian wouldn’t have the expertise to identify and purchase those properties.

Buying a home at an early stage of your life is a bad financial decision you will lose a lot on opportunity costs alone. Your early years are when you should be taking full advantage of investing flexibly to ensure optimal compounding of wealth.

273,Finance Burden After Accident? Do This To Sort It Out.,"People in India get really scared about the financial aftermath of road accidents. 

That's why most of us flee the scene to avoid confrontation. We imagine having to open our wallet and compensate the other person on the spot. Fleeing the scene is disastrous for both you and the other person because you're tampering with the evidence for insurance claim. 

It's actually very chill if you follow the rules. Here's what you do when you meet with an accident:

1) Do not move your car and call up the insurer within 24-48 hours. Take pictures of your car and the accident site
2) They may send a roadside assistance or ask you to move your car to a partner garage depending on the situation
3) If there is third-party accident, then FIR is mandatory. You may not need it for dents and minor scraps. Theft and fire also required FIR
4) Submit documents to insurer and they will assess everything

If you do this, you will never have to worry about financial burden of accidents. Do not get into fights and make cash payments to the other person to settle it.

274,What Are Chit Funds & How You Can Get 10% FD Interest,"People warn you against chit funds, but I’m here to tell you otherwise. 🫡

Chit funds is an age-old system in India, wherein a group of people (50 people) pool a defined sum (Rs 10,000) every month for a fixed period of months (50). Traditionally there are two types of investors in a chit fund, the person who goes with the intent of savings and the other with the intent of financing. 

Chit funds take this pool of money and auction it off to the members, the members bid by placing discounts on the prize money the member with the lowest discount wins, if there is a draw on discount then the winner is selected by ways of a lottery; this difference is the savings for the nonwinning members. 

But did you know that you can make a killer rate of return that is higher than FD rates given by banks through a chit fund? 

The method is simple, apply for auction to win the award from the early months. You may not get the prize in the initial months due to competition but in the middle months due to lack of competition, you can win the prize and place it in an FD with the Chit fund themselves. 

Chit fund FDs give 7-8% returns annually and couple that with the discount income from the auction you can make as far as 10% on your total investment.

⚠️Disclaimer: Always invest in a registered chit fund with a large chit company as there have been cases of misappropriation of money by unregistered chitty.

275,Save Money & Get Rewarded !,"I'm planning to move to Mumbai soon & foresee a lot of new expenses such as air conditioner, refrigerator, television. 😓

I also plan on buying the new iPhone 14 📱to up my video quality and Apple watch to monitor my health. That's right - all the videos you've watched until now have been shot on iPhone 11. 

Usually, we save for these expenses in FDs, savings account or liquid funds because we cannot risk since they are a few months away. 

Investing in stock market for these goals is very risky. ⚠️

But the above-mentioned investment options give us only 4-5% returns. 

Now if you know exactly what you want to buy - for eg a brand new Macbook Air in 6 months then I have a hack for you which can help you save 10% of the cost.

How?

Allow me to introduce you to 👉🏻 Hubble !

This app gives you rewards of 10% every time you save money with them. 

For eg, if you invest INR 10,000 per month for 4 months they will give you INR 4,000 free money & you can start with as low as Rs 500 as well! 💰 

But why are they doing this?

Once you commit to save money for a certain goal, the brand gets to know about this and is willing to give you these discounts because they can plan their inventory better. 

They pass on these savings to you with Hubble. 💯

All the deposits are managed with UPI and at the time of buying, you can redeem the saving and Reward as a brand GIFT VOUCHER to make the purchase!

If you want to purchase the product instantly you can still get a 4% instant cash reward on your money.

If you decide to not purchase that product at a later point in time you can redeem all the money back but obviously without the rewards. 

There is no free lunch 🙂

➡️ You can use my code SHARAN10 to get a further INR 500 discount when you start saving for your first goal on Hubble.

276,How To Buy A Car 🚘,"100-age rule is very dangerous if you follow it blindly. For the uninitiated it basically means that you invest (100-age)% in the stock market. 

For example I’m 26 and let’s say I have 10 Lakhs. According to this rule I should invest 74% (100-26) in the stock market.

But what if this money is meant for my higher studies 3 years from now or a down payment for my home 2 years from now or to pay for my destination wedding next year. Did you know that Indian markets have seen a drop of 60% in a single year? There is nothing stopping from that happening again. So investing 74% of my money in equity for a short term goal is disastrous. You should instead invest in instruments such as T-bills, short term debt funds, small finance bank FDs, and secured bonds.

But how to implement all of this?

👉🏻 This Sunday (25th September), I’m conducting my 2-hour MasterClass again. We will be covering Goal Planning, My Secret Asset Allocation Strategy, Retirement Planning and Insurance Planning. I will also be sharing some of my proprietary tools which you can download and keep forever.

There is limited seating. Last time the seats were filled within 16 hours.

277,Ambani vs Coca-cola ft. @rajshamani,"•Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance
Industries Limited (RIL) has acquired the famous
Campa brand Pure Drinks for an estimated amount of
Rs 22 crore.
•Pure Drinks Group was the sole distributor of Coca-
Cola in India from 1949 to the 1970s. It launched its
own brand Campa Cola in the 1970s, and soon
became the market leader in the soft drinks segment.
•Its business started shrinking in the 1990s after the
Indian government brought in liberalisation rules,
which led to the entry of international giants like
PepsiCo and Coca-Cola.
•Buying Campa is a part of Reliance's wider strategy
to enter the FMCG market.
What do you think, will Campa successfully re-enter
the market and compete with Coca-Cola?

278,Watch This If You’ve NOT Filed Your Income Tax On Time,"July 15th was my birthday, and 15 days later I’m supposed to pay a bomb to the Income Tax department for all the money I made through Instagram. 

Cro... I mean Lakhs of rupees left my bank account. If you think typing the OTP for an INR 800 movie ticket is painful try doing it for xxx Lakhs. 

But what if you forgot to do it on time. 😒

Well, then you pay a penalty of INR 5,000 and interest rate of 1% per month for pending dues. 

But let’s say you have genuine reason. You were ill or lack funds due to financial troubles, or were simply not aware that you’re supposed to do e-Verification after filing income tax, then you can put a ‘Condonation Request’ on the income tax portal. 

If your request is accepted and the reason is genuine then they will forgive the penalty. 

If you have a CA, this is not a problem because they will do it for you. If you’re doing it by yourself, like most of you out there, don’t forget to do the e-Verification. 

Without doing it, you are considered to have not filed the income tax. It will be difficult for you to get Visa for USA and Europe without having IT returns.

279,This Is Why Your Company Health Insurance Is NOT Enough.,"I recently spent close to ₹1 lakh to purchase health insurance for my parents 👨🏻‍💻

Now my parents are both senior citizens 👩🏻‍🦳👨🏻‍🦳 and never had a good health insurance. 

They were not going to spend it by themselves even though they have the money coz we Indians think we are invincible until shit hits the fun. 

So as a responsible son, I bought it for them because I also get tax benefits 😇

👉🏻 What’s the moral of the story?

⚡️Buy a separate health insurance policy when you’re young⚡️

Don’t rely on your company insurance since most of them are Group Health Insurance policies. 

Once you leave the company that insurance policy becomes kaput. Also, it’s never enough especially for those living in metro cities 😮‍💨

If you buy early, the premiums will increase normally even if you have ailments in the future. But if you buy after you retire you would have probably had diabetes, high BP, cholesterol and major surgery by then due to which the premiums go through the roof. 

➡️TLDR: Don’t be like my parents. Buy a separate health insurance asap 👍🏻

280,How To Achieve Financial Independence?,"Unlimited money is everyone's wet dream. 

There's only 2 ways to achieve it:
1) Born to a rich family 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
2) Investment planning 💰 

A lot of us fall in category 2 but it's easier said than done. 

Most of us don't understand how to pick mutual funds - there are 3000+ options. We don't know how to do asset allocation, goal based rebalancing. Even if we do know, we forget to do it coz we are all busy bees working 9-5 jobs if not more. 

In the little time that we get, most of us make the cardinal mistake of looking at only past year's returns. We invest in the top ranked mutual fund of last year and keep repeating the process. Intuitively it sounds like a master plan but in reality it gives shit returns.

According to a research conducted by Business Line if you do that your 10 year returns will be only 7% compared to 11% if you had stayed with the same fund. 😓

This happens because you are not smartly moving your money between equity, debt and gold depending on varying market conditions. 

Asset rebalancing is a fancy word for this. Having the right asset allocation is 90% of the job when it comes to investing.

You can do it by yourself but if you're lazy then I've got your back. 

I'm proud to partner with @etmoney_official to launch their Genius product. 

What does it do? Genius understands your risk profile and time horizon to suggest customised Index MF Portfolio of Equity, Debt & Gold. 

They also recommend you to rebalance the allocation among equity, debt and gold based on market conditions and based on whether your goal is near.

As per backtested data, their High growth Mutual Fund portfolio has given 16.3% CAGR over the past 15 years against the 12% of the benchmark. 📈

My favourite data point is that their probability of getting more than 8% is 100% over an 6 year period.

281,Don’t Break Your FD To Buy Something. Do This Instead.,"One of my friends started making ₹4 lakhs to ₹5 lakhs extra per year after doing this. 🤑

Banks will not tell you this unless you ask for it!!

There is something known as a ‘Sweep-in Facility’ which allows you to convert the excess money in the savings account or current account to an FD. 🏦 

Current account gives 0% interest rate, Savings account give 3.5% interest whereas FDs give 5% to 6%. 

So if you're a business owner with a current account, you might be losing lakhs of rupees if you haven't enabled this.

Now you might ask me- ""Sharan, what's the big deal for salaried people, It's just 2% more interest"". 

Well, let's say you're planning to buy a car or an expensive gadget this year but can't wait to save money. You go to your bank to break your FD to get the money. 

Now let's say you had 5 lakhs in a 3-year FD of 5.5% interest rate. if you want to buy the iPhone 14 you would have to break the entire FD costing you INR 16,000 in penalty because they charge 1% penalty. 

If you had taken a flexi-FD your loss could have been limited to just INR 3,000 because the 1% penalty is charged only on the withdrawn amount and not the total 5 lakhs.

Banks will never tell you this. You need to tell them to enable this, especially for the current account. 🙏🏻

282,"Do This For The Sake Of Your Family, While Getting Insurance.","More than ₹15,000 Crores is lying unclaimed in life insurance policies. That’s enough for me to retire 🙂

Why does this happen?

Most of you guys are not informing your nominees about your life insurance policies. Even if you do, they don’t know where you kept the documents or worse - you lost it.

If you die, they don’t even know that they have crores of rupees waiting for them

👉🏻 Solution:

E-insurance account. 

This is an online platform where you can digitise your life, health and motor insurance policies so they never get lost. 

Your nominess can be sent timely reminders from this platform to tell them that you have looked after their interest and can easily initiate claim process from here. 

These accounts also offer other benefits such as discounts of medicine and free checkups

There are 4 platforms where you can do this. I personally use NSDL platform coz it has the best UI.

283,Don’t Forget To Do This Before Joining A New Company.,"I started with INR 27,833 per month salary at KPMG. 💼 

After a series of 2 quick job changes, my salary increased to 1 lakh per month. 🤑

Every time you make a job shift, you will be forced to open a new bank account with the new employer because the company wants to make money for origination fees 💰 

You will be asked to open salary accounts which are low-maintenance accounts with 0 balance and 0 penalty features. 

You might be thinking, so what if they ask me to open a new salary account. It's all free right?

Wrong! ❌

They don't tell you that after 3 months of inactivity your old salary account will be converted into a normal savings account which would would have minimum balance requirements. 

The charges can be as high as INR 500 per quarter depending the shortfall. 😮‍💨

How to avoid⁉️

Close old salary accounts or remember to maintain the minimum balance there. 

Else, when you finally happen to use that old account it might have zero balance and the bank might report you to the credit bureaus if you owe more penalty than you have in your bank account.

284,Don’t Prepay Home Loan. Newsletter Link In Comment Section.,"Most of us look at loans the wrong way. 😓

We incorrectly assume that lower the interest amount paid the cheaper it is. 

Well, not exactly. ❌

Instead of looking at interest amount paid we should look at effective interest rate. 

For home loans and education loans the effective interest rate after tax benefits is around 4-5% !

No ask yourself this - If you have some extra money, would you want to use it to save 5% interest or invest it to get 10%-12% returns from stock market. 

I know you might say stock market isn’t guaranteed. But home loans are for 20 years. Over 20 year period NIFTY has given 15% CAGR. 

I’m being more conservative and assumed 10-12%. 

👉🏻 For me the answer is the latter. 

However, if handling loans is not your cup of tea or if you have unstable income then prepaying is the better option.

285,Preparing For Higher Studies? Then Watch This.,"Sima aunty from Indian Matchmaking says if you get 60-70% of your criteria in your life partner then you should marry them. 

Unfortunately, Ivy League colleges admissions don’t work that way at least for us Indians. In addition to having a 100% super perfect application, they look for spike factors.

Even though I wasn’t from a Tier 1 college, I made up for it with a high GMAT score, quick career progression and side hustles. 

One thing that helped me with career progression was continuously upskilling myself. 

My employers were kind enough to sponsor my courses which helped me become better at my job. It also helped me stand out in job application. 

My progression to PwC happened through a head hunter (people hired by HRs) without even me applying. 

If you’re someone who is preparing to go for higher education abroad or within India, don’t just focus on exams like GMAT, GRE or CAT but also give importance to upskilling yourself. 

upGrad has been doing some excellent work in helping students upskill in fields such as Data Science, Marketing, MBA etc by partnering with world class institutions such as IITs and IIMs.

286,Keep This In Mind Before Buying Something,"You purchase a pair of jeans for INR 3,500. You tell your mom its INR 2,500 and she finally tells your dad it's INR 2,000. Why do we do this?

In money psychology parlance it's because of something called ‘Arbitrary Coherence’. We all have different notions of what is the fair value for a product. These notions or anchors are primarily influenced by the environment in which we have grown up in. 

When the iPhone was first launched no one had ever seen such a product before. So when Steve Jobs put the figure $999 on the screen it became our anchor for future products in the smartphone category. Android phones today which cost as low as $100 seem like a complete bargain compared to the iPhone because the anchor has already been set in stone inside our head.

So far so good! So now what's the problem? Anchors contrary to what the name suggests are subject to change based on our spending behaviour. If until now, you were comfortable spending INR 3,500 for a pair of jeans it doesn't take that much effort from the sales guy to sell you a INR 4,000 jeans especially if the branding is done right. Now your new anchor is INR 4,000 for a pair of jeans. Before you know it, the cascading effect of arbitrary coherence results you in purchasing INR 10,000 jeans without you even realising what's happening. This is one of the major reasons for lifestyle inflation which is a significant roadblock in increasing our savings rate.

➡️ Moral of the story: If you face a dilemma in purchasing something of high value, call your mom.

287,Exercise And Get Paid? Watch This To Know How.,"Working out 3-4 times a week is a sure shot way of increasing your lifespan by 10-20 years. Not just normal 10-20 years of extra life in which you are alive but constantly live in pain.

But quality healthy years of life extension in which you live like a 30-year-old healthy person even on your sixties.

But unfortunately, most of us, including myself, don't take this seriously because working out is like a chore for most of us. We only work out when we feel like it. Arnold Schwarzenegger kind of bodies only happen when you work out even when you don't feel like it.

But we are humans after all... What's the solution?

What if I told you that you can earn money by working out. I'm sure now you're interested

Some Insurance companies now reward policyholders for working out, running, walking etc. These rewards can be used for discounts up to 30% during renewals or for purchasing medicines or diagnostic tests.

Why are they doing this?

Because insurance companies love healthy people because healthy people don't make claims. No claims mean more profits for them.

288,Move Over FD & Savings Account. Check Out Liquid Funds !!,,2022-08-18,2303383,97470,517,YruqbvpHWZE
289,Recurring Health Issues? Purchase This Health Insurance Plan.,"For the uninitiated, Top-up Insurance is an additional policy over and above the base policy which we are all familiar with. For eg, let's say you have a Base Policy of 5 lakhs cover, if the bill is 6 lakhs then the balance 1 lakh would have to be paid by you. But if you have a top up policy it will cover the additional 1 lakh as well. 

Top up policy comes into play only above a certain amount called the 'deductible'. In the above eg, the deductible was 5 lakhs, so only the amount above 5 lakhs i.e. (6-5=1 lakh) would be paid by the top up policy while the base policy takes care of the 5 lakhs. Hence clubbing both the base and top up policy helps you a get a comprehensive coverage. 

So now you might ask me why not just purchase a base policy for 10 lakhs. The short answer is it's very expensive compared to the above combo. 

Top-up policy comes in 2 forms: 
🔷 Basic 
🔷 Super

Lets understand the difference with the help of an eg - Assume you have a basic top-up plan with a cover of ₹5 lakhs and deductible 3 lakhs. Now say, two claims arise in a year; the first one of ₹1.5 lakh and the second one of ₹2.5 lakh. The basic top-up plan will NOT settle both claims because in both cases your health claim did not exceed the deductible limit of ₹3 lakh. However, in the case of super top-up plan, the total of both admissible claims will be considered for the deductible. 

➡️ People who are prone to recurring health problems in a year such as heart or sugar related should opt for super-top up plan.

291,Get 7% Fixed Deposit Interest Rate !,"Should we boycott FDs just coz they give lower interest rate? 

Absolutely not. 

For goals which are less than 1-2 years away FDs are still the best investment option. 

I'm talking about saving for Iceland vacation, iPhone 14, new car etc. 

They are even able to beat most short-term debt funds because before 3 years the tax treatment is the same for both.

I'm not talking about FDs from nationalised bank such as HDFC, ICICI, Canara bank, SBI etc which give 4% to 5% FD returns which they publicise like the cure to cancer.

I'm talking about FD from Small Finance banks which give 6% to 7% returns and often not talked about. 

The only catch is that these banks are comparatively riskier, since they lend to small business and farmers. 

But there is a hack !!

If you invest less than 5 lakhs in a Small Finance Bank, then RBI has got your back since they insure it. 

This 5 lakhs is inclusive of interest earned, so I would say don't invest more than 4 lakhs in a Small Finance bank FD.M, if you have more than one multiple accounts in other people's name or in a different bank all together.

➡️ Bottom line: For your next iPhone you can consider investing in a Small Finance bank FD.

292,Harry Potter Finance - Don’t Put All Money In Fixed Deposit !,"Why is it so hard to convince ourselves to avoid investing a bulk of our networth in Fixed Deposits? 🤔

This is because of something called ‘Risk Aversion’. 

Most of us cannot fathom the fact that investing in the stock market 📉 entails a probability of losing a part of our principal investment. Even though the probability tends towards zero over a 7-8 year time horizon, we are unwilling to invest our hard earned money unless it gives guaranteed returns. 💰 

But we don’t realise that putting all our money in 100% assured zero risk investments such as Fixed Deposits is a sure shot way of guaranteeing negative real returns after considering tax and inflation. Even though we see the absolute number increasing year over year, the purchasing power of our slow growing money decreases. It will take us significantly longer to achieve our financial goals if we ever reach them at all. 🙌🏻

Hence, it is important to allocate a certain portion of our portfolio towards riskier asset classes such as Equity, to ensure real growth in the value of our overall portfolio over a long term period. Even though there is a probability of facing short term losses, it is imperative to build the financial discipline to stomach those losses and understand that’s it’s part of the process which would eventually lead to real growth in the value of our wealth over a long term period. Taking no risk at all is also a kind of risk which we don’t realise until it’s too late. 🤗

293,Avoid This Type Of Mutual Funds !,"Avoid investing in actively managed large cap mutual funds. 

Why? 

83% of them were unable to beat the benchmark over a 5 year period. 

You see - every actively managed fund is trying to beat the benchmark. For large cap funds the benchmark is NIFTY 100 index fund.

Now this index fund is just blindly investing in the top 100 companies of India in proportion of their size. Hence, there is no fund manager actively looking at the investments coz it's all automated. 

Due to this, the expense ratio is ten times lesser compared to actively managed large cap funds. 

So if a large cap fund is struggling to beat the index, why the hell are you investing in it and paying more in fees? 

Large cap active mutual funds lose their advantage as the country becomes more developed. 

Midcap and small cap mutual funds still have that edge. The US stock market has already seen these changes happen.

How to invest?
👉🏻 Sort large cap index funds in increasing order of expense ratio and tracking error
👉🏻 Filter out funds less than 250 Crore
👉🏻 Give 80% weightage to expense ratio and 20% weightage to tracking error for ranking (lower the better)
👉🏻Pick the top ones in their respective category

294,Hack To Get 30% To 40% Cheaper Health Insurance.,"Hack to get 30% to 40% cheaper health insurance. 🏥 

Health insurance is expected to increase by 15% to 16% CAGR over the next few years owing to rising medical costs and increasing claims.

What can you do⁉️

Lock in lower health insurance cost today by purchasing 3 year plans. 

You get an upfront 10% to 15% discount & also don’t have to worry about rising premium costs in the near future. 

What about tax benefits? 💰 

As per section 80D, you’re allowed to claim health insurance as a tax deduction, upto ₹25,000. 

You might think that you won’t be able to take that benefit every year if you purchase the insurance for 3 years in one shot.

Don’t worry !! You can divide the cost over 3 years and claim every year.

295,Don’t Forget To Do This While Buying Car Insurance.,"A brand new car loses somewhere between 9-11% of its value, the moment you drive it off the showroom lot. The culprit? Depreciation. 🚗 

Since our vehicles are primarily a mechanical device it is prone to regular wear and tear and loses its efficiency over time thereby losing its value. According to IRDAI, by the 4th year your vehicle will lose around 50% of its value due to depreciation. The depreciation rates also varies as per the component of the car. For eg - rubber, nylon, plastic parts and batteries have the highest depreciation rates. 

When we make insurance claims for damage to our vehicles the insurer will not cover the depreciation cost of the components being replaced. For eg, if your car is more than 4 years old then you may have to pay close to 50% of the bill. 

To avoid paying this, it is recommended to also get a ‘Zero Depreciation Add-on’ to your vehicle insurance. This add-on typically costs 15% of the base insurance premium and varies as per the model of your car, location and age. It is not available for vehicles older than 5 years.

296,"Watch This, If You’re Going Abroad For Higher Studies !","Most Indians 🇮🇳 dream of going to the USA 🇺🇸 or Europe for higher studies because they get higher pay, better quality of life and arguably better education. 

The #1 thing which surprises them after landing in the USA is the cost of medical expenses. For eg, a simple ultra-scan costs INR 80,000 in USA compared to INR 2000 in India.

Long story short, you cannot survive there without medical insurance. 

A friend of mine who is studying in Ohio state university is currently paying around INR 2.7 L a year for medical insurance. This is because his university mandates him to purchase health insurance from the university which is insanely expensive. If your university doesn't have that restriction then you should consider alternative options which are way cheaper. 

Check [iso.org](http://iso.org/) if your university has that restriction. 

Alternate options:

👉🏻 Purchase student travel insurance from Indian insurance companies. A $100,000 cover can be obtained for as less as INR 15,000 per year. They also compensate you if you miss a semester due to health reasons and also pay for your parent's flight to visit you. You should buy this even if your university has the mandate to purchase from them coz the above features are unique to Indian health insurance companies. 
👉🏻 Purchase from 3rd party insurance companies like ISOA. The heath insurance premiums are 50-75% cheaper through this company. The only catch is that the deductibles are high so you might have to foot the bill for minor bills. You can club this with the student travel insurance from Indian companies to cover all your expenses.

But you can deduct a further ₹50,000 for your senior citizen parents (₹25,000 if less than 60 years old). This brings to a grand total of INR 75,000 in deductions which can save you up to INR 22,500 in taxes.

But what if you're unable to utilise this entire ₹75,000. In that case you're allowed to claim a further deduction of up to ₹5,000 on preventive health check ups, diagnostics etc. For next year’s tax planning don’t forget to do this

299,"Must Watch, If You Have Multiple Loans.","Most successful rich people👩🏻‍💼 on this planet became rich by taking on loans/debt to fund their business ideas. 

Indian society views debt as a huge headache because we hear ample stories of relatives getting financially ruined when they are unable to repay. 

Most of us will go through at least 3-4 loans in our lifetime such as education loan, vehicle loan, home loan, personal loan, gold loan etc. 💴 

For middle class Indian, it becomes almost impossible to not take a loan to achieve our life goals. 

The ability to handle debt is a true life skill. Something which has not been taught to us. 😓

One of the methods to smartly handle debt is called ⚡️Debt Avalanche Method⚡️

You first arrange your loans in decreasing order of interest rates. 

For example:
🔹Credit card loan: 36% interest rate. EMI 12,000 per month
🔹Personal loan: 16% interest rate. EMI 22,000 per month
🔹Vehicle loan: 9% interest rate. EMI 35,000 per month
🔹Home loan: 7% interest rate. EMI 53,000 per month

You now pay the minimum EMIs for all 4 loans religiously. 💸

Any extra amount that you have, you pay towards the first loan i.e. credit card loan since that has the highest interest rate. That way you are optimising your overall interest rate. 

Once the credit card loan is done you use the freed-up credit card EMI (INR 12,000 per month) plus the excess money to pre-pay the personal loan. 

Once the personal loan is done you use the freed-up credit card EMI (INR 12,000 per month) and freed-up personal loan EMI (INR 22,000 per month) plus an excess amount to pre-pay the vehicle loan. 

You get the idea.✨

I personally wouldn't pre-pay a home loan since the tax-adjusted interest rates are super low (4-5%) to even worry about. 

I would rather put the excess money in stock market. (Personal view, pls do your own research)

300,Alternative To Fixed Deposits,"Need to save up for an iPhone? 📱 

Or a vacation to Paris in 1 year. 🇫🇷

For goals that are less than 1 year away & you know exactly when you would be needing the money, FDs are the preferred choice. 

If you don't know when you need the money and you're someone who likes to purchase stuff on a whim then Liquid Funds are the best suited.

BUT, FDs of nationalised and private banks are not giving enough returns today. Most of these banks are giving 5.5% to young people and maybe 6% for senior citizens.

What's the alternative?

✨T- Bills✨

These are like loans given to the government. 

Now the government is assumed to never default on their loans because they can just print more money. 

Also, the government is giving 6.2% interest for 1 year T Bills which is more than most FD. 

T-Bills are also tax-friendly since there is no TDS deducted unlike FDs

How to invest?

RBI has recently launched the RBI Retail Direct website for investing in government securities. 

If you want something user-friendly then Zerodha also offers it (not a promo). I personally use the platform so I'm mentioning it. 

👉🏻 Please tell me if you have invested in T-Bills and how did you do it?

301,How Insurance Is Mis-sold In India 🇮🇳 Watch Carefully !,"How to scam someone?

🔹Step 1: You get a list of loan seekers from the bank and start calling them offering a 0% interest rate loan if they purchase a life insurance policy
🔹Step 2: After they purchase the policy keep stalling them for 30 days (free-look period)
🔹Step 3: Collect the 30-40% commissions from the insurance company and block the number

This is how 70% of insurance mis-selling happens in India. In reality, it is possible to take a loan against your insurance policy but only on the surrender value which is usually just 30% of the premiums paid. 

➡️ For example, let’s say you purchased a 10 year insurance policy of 2 lakhs premium per year with a maturity amount of 20 lakhs payable after 20 years. 

If you paid for 5 years (total premium paid: 2*5 = 10 lakhs), the surrender value would be 3 lakhs (30% * 10 lakhs) and the loan amount would be ~2.4 lakhs (80% of surrender value) at 10% interest rate. But the scammer will tell you that you can get the 20 lakh loan as soon as you purchase the insurance policy at 0% interest rate.

➡️ Bottom line: If it sounds too good to be true, tell him ""Kya phook ke aya be?""

302,Rent vs Buy Wedding Edition,"Marriage is one of the 3 moments in our life when no expenses are spared. 

Guess the other 2?

One of the main expenses during a wedding is designer clothes which we wear for a grand total of 1 time in our life but spend lakhs. 

Don't tell me you will wear it again at someone else's wedding. You *might* wear it once, but will eventually grow out of it and want to buy something new. 

Also, your friends will remember your older outfit and ridicule you for wearing the same thing again.

I know..we live in a sh!tty world. 

So, what did I do? 

I was recently invited to my friend @simranbalarjain wedding. Now this was an influencer wedding. I can't show up in shirt and jeans and straight away head to the buffet counter like how I used to when I was a kid. I had to bring my A game but I didn’t want to spend lakhs on something that I would be wearing only once. 

To make matters worse there were 6-7 events and Simran had suggested a unique outfit for each one of them. Ya right? 😒

But she also suggested this rental place called Flyrobe (don’t worry, I didn’t get paid for this) where I could rent the clothes from. 

Life saver. I spent only INR 6000 for 3 outfits which probably costed 1.3 lakhs MRP. 

If you're a woman you might also need to get jewellery. 

Now jewellery as you already know is a waste of investment coz of the making charges. There are now companies like Rentjewels and Eves24 that allow you rent jewellery for 3-5% of MRP. (Again - I didn’t get paid for this)

Please suggest other wedding outfit rental places for the benefit of others! I’ll be looking at the comment section closely.

304,"For Emergency, Don’t Sell Mutual Funds At Loss, Do This Instead !!","So your fiancé wants to get married in Santorini and honeymoon in Iceland. 🥲

Obviously, you don't have that kind of liquid money because you spent your 20s pissing away your salary on LIITs and jäger-bombs. 

What next?

You started investing in some mutual funds 5 years back after listening to finance influencers but now the market is down. 

But your baby💓 comes first so you decided to sell your mutual funds at a loss.

Hold on!

What if I told you, you could borrow against your mutual funds. 

That's right. You can actually get a loan against your mutual fund for as little as 7-9% interest rate. 

You can get up to 65% of equity mutual funds and 80% of debt mutual funds as a loan. 

So instead of selling your mutual funds at a loss, you can actual keep it intact and borrow against it.

Before you do this, you can also explore loan against FD and loan against jewellery since they have lower interest rates. 

You can also liquidate a little bit of your PPF or EPF balance for marriage purposes. 

Or you could just not have an expensive wedding just to show off to your friends and peers. It's just 1 day of your life guys. Why spend 50-60% of your networth on 1 day? 

If you're someone who is okay with a court marriage then hit me up 😇

➡️ Bottom line: Don't sell mutual funds because of an emergency especially in a bear market. You can get a loan against them and wait for the eventual recovery in the market.

305,Mental Accounting,"We humans are very irrational creatures when it comes to handling our 💰 

Even though value of every ₹100 note in every one’s wallet is the same, we assign different values to it based on our circumstances. For eg: A ₹100 note would mean the world to us when thinking of getting a Netflix subscription. On the other hand, spending ₹300 for the hot chocolate ☕️ at Starbucks becomes spare change. Why does this happen? 

Our mind subconsciously creates multiple accounts in our head for each kind of activity and hence we allocate different value to money based on those activities. But this is the wrong ❌ way of doing it.
We need to convert every rupee leaving our pockets in terms of opportunity cost. 

Next time you spend money, ask yourself “What else could I buy with this money” and if you’re not able to think of anything better, only then spend it. This will help you significantly curtail your expenditure and increase your savings rate.

307,Important Thing To Know While Investing In Mutual Funds !,"All of us have that 1 friend who is super smart with stock market or crypto investing. 

We might have also offered to give all our money to that person asking them to handle it. 

Similarly, when a mutual fund company performs really well we might be tempted to put all our money in that company's various funds. 

Here's why that might not be a good idea: 

👉🏻 Concentration risk: There is usually a lot of overlap between different mutual funds of the same company. For eg, there is an 83% overlap between HDFC Flexi cap fund and HDFC Top 100 fund. So much overlap is not good for diversification

👉🏻 Similar fund view: More often than not, the same fund manager will be responsible for multiple funds. He / she might impose the same investment philosophy on the future outlook of various industries on multiple funds. So if 1 fund underperforms all of them will underperform. For eg, HDFC mutual fund all have an inclination towards PSU stocks

This is also true for debts where the views on interest rate movement and the company's debt repayment capabilities can have a cascading effect on all the debt funds within the company.

➡️ TLDR: Along with asset diversification also do fund house diversification to take the extra precaution.

308,New Age Banking Is Here !,"Most banking apps have been designed with the intention to give the user a fit of rage. 🤬

I'm especially talking about the government-owned banks…no surprises there. 

Due to this, digital adoption has been super slow, forcing people to still go to branches to open a new bank account or an FD. 

I recently opened a new bank account at ICICI where I already have an existing account. 😑 Even then I was required to undergo KYC again because they were not able to fetch my KYC details. 

I was also asked to send a video of me blinking to show them that I'm alive. Apparently, people are opening accounts in dead people's name. I mean what the actual fuck...🫠

Solution? ➡️ Neo Banks !!

Neobanks are actually not banks at all because they don't have a banking license. 

You see, RBI is very anal about giving new licenses to just anybody. So neobanks piggybank on existing banks and help them acquire new customers through their superior technology. 

Neobanks are essentially fintech companies with exceptional product managers and developers, who make the banking experience seem like a modern social media app thereby attracting millennials and GenZ. 

They take a cut from the banks for helping them acquire customers.

Since they don't have a physical presence, they have lower costs and this can offer higher interest rates, waive off forex charges and minimum account balance. 

They also help track your spending and give you insights whenever you're off track. 

➡️ Do you use a neobank? Have you faced any bad experience? Let me know which to choose and which to avoid 👇🏻

309,Why You Will Never Be Rich !,"Is there a magic number to hit in your bank account after which you can call yourself rich? 

As a little kid 👦🏻, my only aim in life was to become the richest person on the planet 🌏 . I thought that was the ultimate goal in life and that it would make me truly happy beyond all measures. But as I started earning and continued to get salary hikes I quickly realised that the happiness was only short lived 😞. You quickly become accustomed to the enhanced lifestyle the increased salary gives you and then you’re back to square one. What was happening? 🤔 

ENVY!

Picture this scenario. We are all eternally climbing this ladder of success 🪜. You only get to see the 10 rungs above you. As you climb a new rung (salary hike) you start noticing the 11th rung which earlier  was invisible to you. That 11th rung is the new set of people / opportunities that come into our life as you keep climbing. So now again, we have 10 rungs above us which we must climb before we can call ourselves “rich”. But the cycle just repeats and there is no end to it unless of course if you’re Elon Musk. 😂 

At the end of the day, we do not desire to be rich, we desire to be richer than others. So does this mean, we should forget about making more money and be happy with what we have. Absolutely not ❌ But let that not be the deciding factor for your happiness. Else it’s a losers game. The odds are literally 7.7 billion is to 1.

It’s like Jay Z 🎤says: “The goal is not to be successful and famous. That's not the goal. The goal is, if you have a specific God-given ability, is to live your life out through that.” 💯 

Once you fathom the essence of this statement, you will truly become rich. So keep climbing up the ladder but don’t forget to enjoy the view along the way :)

310,Don’t Fall For This Sales Strategy (Relativity Cue Bias),"Are you guilty of purchasing something overly expensive especially after making a huge purchase? 

For example, have you ever purchased cadbury silk 🍫 or other expensive chocolates kept at the checkout counters of supermarkets but would think twice before purchasing it from a kirana store? That's because in the former example, we have just spent thousands of rupees purchasing 40-50 items from the supermarket 💵 and don't really feel the pinch of a couple of extra hundred bucks leaving our pockets. 

Don't worry we are all guilty of it. 😅 It happens because of something called the - Relativity Cue Bias. Let me know in the comments section below any other such example where we splurge money biased by relativity. 💭⬇️

311,Health Insurance Will Get Rejected If You Don’t Know This ft. Anant Ladha,"One of the most common reasons for health insurance rejection is…not informing the insurer on time. ⏰ 

But why?

Well you see, insurance frauds are a big deal. 🎭

If there are too many fraudulent claims the insurer will go under and would be forced to increase premiums the next year. 

To avoid this they keep a very small time frame ⏳ to make the claims reducing the chances of fraud.

For cashless claims, you need to inform the insurer atleast 2-3 days before hospitalisation if it is planned. For emergencies you need to inform within 24 hours after hospitalisation. 💵 

If you're unable to avail cashless facility all is not lost. 

You can pay the hospital from your pocket and then get a reimbursement claim from the insurer within 1-2 weeks of receiving discharge from the hospital. 🏥 

Obviously, this is not preferred coz the process is much longer.

➡️ Bottom line: Inform the insurer asap once you're hospitalised !!

314,Get 12% Interest By Lending Money To Strangers,"Most of us have lent money to our friends at 0% interest rate. 

As per my poll on Instagram, around 72% of you have not gotten your money back. 

In banking terminology, it means that the money lent has become NPA. 

⬇️ Tag those friends in the comment section below to let them know that they are an NPA. 

🙇🏻‍♂️My suggestion - Do not lend money to friends especially if they are close friends. If you do, then assume it's gone and don't ask for it back. You do not want money to be the reason for breaking your friendship. 

Money is important but not more important than your relationships

Naturally, most of us are not comfortable lending money to strangers at 0% interest rate. 

I mean- Why would you? 

How about if you get 9-12% interest rate. This kind of returns cross the jiggle territory. 

Usually banks do this on your behalf. They take your money in a savings account and give it to businesses. They charge 12% to the business, give you 4% and keep the rest. They guarantee that your money will never be lost and even insure you up to 5 lakhs.

What if you want to lend it yourself? 

That's what P2P Lending (Peer to Peer lending) is all about. 

Now you take all the risk. There is no insurance. But the returns are juicy. 

This falls under the realm of alternate investment assets. Other investment options in this asset class are crypto, lease financing, venture capital, venture debt etc. 

This asset class can be upto 10-15% of your portfolio because they are mostly delinked from stock market returns and act like a hedge.

Some of the companies in India offering P2P lending are: Cred Mint, BharatPe, RupeeCircle, LenDenClub and Finzy. 

➡️Have you invested in P2P lending? Let me in the comment section below along with your experience (both good and bad) 

Let us help each other know what platforms to avoid and what to trust since this is relatively new.

316,Don’t Forget About This To Maintain High Credit Card Score ft. Batman & Joker,"The credit card age is the 3rd most important factor for your credit score, accounting for nearly 15% of the total weightage after repayment history and credit utilisation. 

As such, it is recommended to keep your old credit card accounts active even if you do not use them since the credit rating agencies such as CIBIL, consider the average age of all your credit cards. Having a high credit age is better for your credit score as it shows that you have a lot of experience in handling credit. 

It's highly unlikely to get a score higher than 800 if you’re young, because your credit age likely will be less than that of a person who has had credit for years.

317,Missed Your Home Loan EMI Payment? Do This Next.,"Knock knock!
Who's there?
Gunda
Gunda who?
Gunda who's going to break your legs if you don't pay off the home loan EMIs. 

Home loan is probably is the biggest loan which we will take in our lifetimes. 

We spend close 20-30 years trying to repay this loan. A bulk of our income goes towards paying this loan. Naturally, if shit hits the fan (such as job loss or health ailments) we are most likely to default.

If you miss 3 instalments, the bank will send you a final 60 days notice under the SARFESI Act. 

As per this, the bank has the right to seize your property without going to court. I know brutal 🙂 The bank is going to auction your property to recover the loan and kick you out.

What should you do?

1) Bribe the branch manager. Just kidding 🙃 Try to explain your situation. If you have a good credit score and have a genuine short term reason he/she would give you some more time. 

2) Increase the loan tenure to reduce the EMI cost and make it more manageable. Always try to keep the EMI within 40% of your income. 

3) Liquidate your provident fund to repay the loan. You can liquidate up to 3 years of income form the PF. This will give you enough time to sort out your situation. 

4) If all of this still doesn't work, try to sell the home by yourself. Bank doesn't have your best interests at heart. It's a distress sale for them. They will sell it just enough to get their money back. You can protest but it still won't get the best market price.

318,Negotiation Skill During Job Interview,"Most fresh graduates and people early in their career (less than 30) do not take the time to read the offer letter end to end and only focus on the salary bit. 

Can't blame them 🙂

Also, the offer letter format is vastly different from company to company. But we assume it's all going to be the same.

What should you focus on? 

🔹The bonus is usually clubbed with the CTC and there are certain clauses such as ""min 6 months of employment in a financial year"" to be eligible for it. If you're joining a company less than 6 months before March, then you won't get the bonus for another 1.5 years. This is very common. Be on the lookout for this. You cannot get this removed. But what you can do is use this point to negotiate a better base pay. Maybe the base pay is lower than your current CTC.

🔹Another nasty clause is the bond. Data analytics companies are notorious for this. They even ask you to pay back money if you leave before the stipulated time. How can you tackle this? The only way to do this is to have multiple job offers. If you remember, the HR always asks you if you have other offers. You can hear the HR's sigh of relief when you say that you're only sitting for 1 company because they know you have ZERO leverage.

Don’t be in a rush to sign an employment bond. We recommend these things to check for before signing:

✔️Time period of binding contract should be reasonable. 
✔️Consequences incase of breach of contract in terms of compensation or reputation loss. 

➡️ Follow us for more!

319,Upskill At Work & Save Tax,"Ever since the pandemic, the number of people investing in online courses has skyrocketed. 

Don't believe me? 

Ask your friends what did they do during the lockdown? I'm sure 9/10 would say that they took an online course. Even their resumes would be filled with that 🙂

Did you know that you can show these expenses as a tax exemption?

➡️ It's called Research Allowance.

Let's say you spent INR 5,000 on a course or a subscription to do something that would make you better at your job. You can tell your HR to give you the INR 5,000 as a research allowance in next month's payslip. 

If you belong to the 30% income bracket, you save INR 1,500. So the effective cost of the course is INR 3,500. 

➡️ Bottom line: Use the Research Allowance to get an additional discount on your course purchases.

Share with all your friends and follow for more such tips to save money.

320,What If There Was A Mutual Fund For Commercial Properties?,"Buying a residential property in India is one of the dumbest things you can do in India given rental yields are only 2-3%. 

Commercial properties on the other hand give 6-7%. 

Only problem? You need to be a crorepati to even get a foot in the door.

What if there was a mutual fund for commercial properties?

Imagine investing in 10-15 office properties across India with just ₹300 to ₹500. REITs allow you to do this. REITs give you the 6-7% as dividend income. You also get the benefit of capital appreciation every year. All in all you could get close to 10-15% through REITs. They are a good investment option during high inflationary environment like right now. 

It is recommended to invest about 5% to 10% of your assets in REITs to get the optimal diversification.

321,How To Buy Insurance If Multiple People Use A Vehicle,"Most middle-class households in India possess a scooter to commute short distances. 

This scooter will most likely be shared by multiple members of the family because having a separate scooter for all is not a priority.

But the insurance is only in one person's name? Let's say it's in your name. 

Now if your younger brother decides to do some wheelie on the scooter and crashes, the insurance company may reject the claim because it's not in your younger brother's name. 

The way to avoid this is to include his name as a Paid Driver.

➡️ TLDR: If multiple people are using a vehicle the add them as paid drivers in the insurance policy to avoid claim rejection.

322,Don’t Have Money To Fight At Court? Watch This !!,"44 million cases are pending in all of India including 73,000 in the Supreme Court. 

This is because a large number of cases are not tried at the correct time due to the absence of proper funding. 

It's a well-known fact that rich people and big corporations get away with bad stuff because they have access to the best lawyers money can buy. 

For example, let's say a big corporation has sold faulty equipment to a small company. The latter demands a refund and is given a low ball settlement offer. The smaller company does not have the time or money to take them to court. Also, legal cost becomes a significant cost head to the small company lowering its profit and valuation. A small company is very particular about its valuation in the early years. So it might bend over and accept the small amount.

➡️ Solution:
Enter Litigation Financing. 

This is a type of alternate investment option where retail investors like you and me can fund the company's litigation cost and get a % of the settlement offer if they win. The returns are close to 100% IRR in countries like USA. 

Litigation financing is slowly picking up in India. 

Do not invest in such investment options until you're financially sorted. It should be a part of your alternate investment portfolio which in turn should not exceed more than 10-15% of your assets. 

If you're a newbie stay from litigation financing. If you're a mature investor who has already invested in stocks, mutual funds and gold then you may explore this.

323,Hack To Increase Insurance Cover By 60% At No Additional Cost,"A hack to increase your insurance coverage by up to 60% at no additional cost -

Insurance companies reward you if you're a healthy person and don't see the insides of the hospital. They increase your insurance coverage by as much as 60% if you don't make any claims. 

This is called the No Claim Bonus and I'm sure many of you already know about this. 

BUT...

What if you make a small claim, let's say a simple appendicitis surgery which costs INR 60-70k. But the overall health insurance cover is INR 10 lakhs. That's just 7% of the cover amount. 

Some insurance companies are now saying that if the claim is less than 25% of the cover amount, they will let it go and still give you the NCB benefit. How kind of them 🙂

This is called NCB Protector.

➡️ Action item for you: Ask your insurer if they have this benefit. Also, check aggregator platforms like Policy Bazaar, Insurance Dekho, Acko etc and see if any insurance company have this. I know of one.

324,How To Get A 2Cr Education Loan To Study In America,"So you got into the college of your dreams. 

Unfortunately, these degrees don't come cheap, especially for people from 3rd world countries like India. 

In fact, in some colleges the tuition for foreign students are hiked to subsidize the cost for the locals. To rub salt into your wounds, education inflation is close to 9-10%, so it will not get easier. 

The only alternative is Education Loan. 

My recommendation is to always go for a secured loan by pledging your home because the interest rates are halved as compared to going for an unsecured loan. For eg, a secured loan from Canara Bank can cost only 8-8.5% interest rate whereas a unsecured loan from HDFC Credila can be as high as 14%. When the amount is in Crores, the difference can be HUGE. 

Okay, so you have a home ready. 

Unfortunately, there is a home loan on that. Or your sibling has already pledged the home for his / her education loan. You might falsely assume that you are not eligible for a secure loan anymore and might go for an unsecured one with sky-high interest rates. Some banks might also tell you this to mislead you.

Reality: You can still get it provided you've paid up at least 20-30% of the loan amount. The new collateral value will be calculated differently. 

➡️ Here is an example. 
Assume:
Home value: 1 Crore
Home loan pending: 50 lakhs
New collateral value: 1 Crore - 1.5 (50 lakhs) = 25 lakhs

So you can still get an education loan of up to 25 lakhs. The balance can be procured from unsecured means if required.

➡️Exception: Home pledged for Personal and business loans cannot be used for education loan again.

Unfortunately, your family doesn't know the ABCD of finance and is clueless as to what to do with so much money? 

Have you heard stories of Kaun Banega Crorepati winners becoming broke within a year? You don't want that to happen to your family. So what can you do?

Enter Monthly Payout Term Insurance 💸

As the name suggests, this term insurance gives your family a lumpsum amount let's say INR 50 lakhs and another INR 50,000 per month for the next 15 years. That way, even if they are reckless, they are limited to losing only a small amount per month.

➡️ Caveat: Obviously, getting the 100% lump sum amount is better from an IRR perspective but only if your family knows what they are doing. 

➡️ Bottom line: If your family  is a finance noob you need to tweak your term insurance plan to a monthy payout option. Else you can ask them to follow me and choose the normal term insurance plan 😊

As per the Motor Vehicles Act of India, it is mandatory to have only third party insurance for vehicles. Third party insurance covers the damages caused to the other person in the accident and not you. Also, the limit for third party insurance is capped to INR 7.5 lakhs for vehicle damage.

So if you drive a Ferrari with only a third party insurance, you are only covered for INR 7.5 lakhs by the person who crashed into your car. The balance would have to be paid by you. Also any damage caused to your vehicle which doesn't involve a third party vehicle such as natural calamity, theft, fire or falling coconuts leaves you completely exposed.

Hence having a comprehensive car insurance is crucial to protect your vehicle from own damages. If you already have a third party insurance then you can purchase a standalone Own Damage Insurance to complement it.

Let's solve a rudimentary math problem from our schooling days ➡️

INR 100 invested 1 year back is INR 110 today. What's the rate of return? 10% of course! Easy peasy...Now before you call your 10 year old son to solve the next problem, please bear with me. What if you instead invested INR 100 spread evenly across the 12 months or INR 8.33 every month? Let's say you still end up with INR 110 at the end of the year. What is the rate of return now? Remember that the total invested amount is still INR 100. Is the rate of return 10% still? Wrong ❌ IT IS 18.8%!!

What's happening here? Well, if you observe closely, you will notice that the average time of investment has reduced significantly. Only INR 8.33 is invested for the entire 12 months and the subsequent investments for 11 months, 10 months and so on. This is exactly what happens with our SIP investments.

To calculate the returns for this investment type, we need something called the XIRR or Extended Internal Rate of Return. You would’ve seen this figure on your investment dashboard on Zerodha' Coin, Groww etc. XIRR is that single rate of return, which when applied to every installment would give the current value of the total investment.

Since all of us have very different investment dates, the XIRR would vary widely even for investors in the same mutual fund. The returns shown by mutual fund houses on their websites assumes one lump sum investment. But in reality, most of us invest continuously across different dates. That's why our personal returns seldom matches the returns shown by fund houses. Now you know why 😁

Last week we spoke about the various investment options available to senior citizens which ensure capital preservation and beat FD returns. Maxing out investments in the available schemes resulted in a pre-tax income of INR 40,000 per month. But what if you need more?

A Systematic Withdrawal Plan in debt funds can help us out here. It is exactly the opposite of an SIP, where a certain amount is withdrawn every month to meet your monthly expenses. It is recommended to leave the debt fund untouched for at least 3 years and then start a SWP. That way you become eligible for the lower LTCG taxation at 20% along with indexation benefits.

The catch: Most fintech apps do not permit SWP for obvious reasons. You will need to deal with the mutual fund company directly to facilitate this. Let me know below if you have enabled SWPs on any of your portfolio and why?

Have you spoken to your parents about investing? Do you know where they have invested their hard earned money?

Most of our parents are pushing 60 at which point they significantly reduce their risk appetite and look for safer modes of investment, leading them to Fixed Deposits. However, there are several other fixed income investment options which have been customised for senior citizens:

🔹Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS): You can invest up to 15 lakhs in this scheme and get 7.4% interest rate which is paid quarterly. It has a 5 year lock in period. Investment in this scheme also fall under section 80C giving you tax benefits

🔹Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY): This is very similar to SCSS. You can invest upto 15 lakhs and has a 10 year lock in period. The interest rate is 7.4% paid either monthly, quarterly or yearly. Choose the yearly option to get a higher interest rate

🔹Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS): This is not just for senior citizens. You can invest up to 4.5 lakhs and get an interest rate of 6.6% paid monthly. It has a lock in period of 5 years.

If both your mom and dad max out the investment in the above mentioned schemes INR 69 lakhs they can get a monthly pre-tax income of INR 40,000. In the current fixed income market, these interest rates stand out and offer the best investment option for senior citizens.

➡️ Disclaimer: This advice is only recommended for those who have just enough corpus to last them for next 20-30 years. But if you're someone who has enough money to last another lifetime and wish to leave a significant corpus to your kids, then higher equity investing is recommended.

There is nothing worse than getting your health insurance claim rejected just because you forgot to mention a pre-existing condition. You would be kicking yourself over it for the rest of your life.

Disclosing these important details is crucial because it directly impacts the premium calculation. But what if you never knew you have these ailments in the first place?

In that case, it's always a good idea to get a full body check up before getting your health insurance to rule out all possibilities. This full body check up certificate will also stand as proof in the future in case of any disagreements with the insurance company.

Your health insurance may have a flaw that you're completely unaware of and might cost you lakhs of rupees.

Always purchase the base and top up policy on the same day. Why you may ask? Let's take an example ➡️

Base plan of INR 5 Lakh (Plan year: January 2021 to December 2021)
Top-up of Rs. 25 Lakh with an annual deductible of Rs. 5 Lakhs (Plan year: April 2021 to March 2022).

Now, say you undergo two hospitalizations in the year 2021.
The first one happens in January 2021, the bill amount is Rs. 5 Lakh. Now this is covered by your base-plan there is no confusion, and the claim amount is paid.

Next - you undergo a hospitalization in April 2021. And the bill comes to 1.5 Lakhs.

Now, take a guess on - who will pay for this?

A. Base-plan

B. Super Top-up

C. You

If you guessed A or B - then you'll be up for a BIG surprise! Here's how your two insurance plans will look at the second claim.

Your base plan will not pay: Because - you have already exhausted the cover amount available for the year (January 2021 - December 2021)

Your Super Top-up will not pay: Because the Super Top-up plan pays only when the hospitalization expenses during the policy period of April 2021 to March 2022 crosses the deductible of 5 Lakhs. In this case, the total hospitalization expenses during the period in question (Apr 21 to Mar 22) are only Rs. 1.5 Lakhs - hence the claim won't be payable.

On the first day of my job, the new joinees were given a presentation by 4 different banks on the benefits and perks of their debit and credit cards. While it is understandable for the sales guys to not talk about the negative aspects of credit cards, I think it is essential for companies and schools to teach us about how credit cards work.

I was surprised to know that even my freshly minted IIM MBA colleagues did not fully understand how credit cards worked until they made some mistakes along the way. I was fortunate enough to learn from their mistakes and avoid them. Last year, credit card companies made a whopping $76 Bn interest income, meaning the 40% interest they charge if you are unable to repay them every month.

If you happen to be one of the contributors to that harrowing figure, then let me introduce to you “Credit Card Balance Transfer”. It's a concept where you transfer the outstanding credit card balance from one credit card to another which has 0% or a reduced interest rate for a certain period.

Some of the Indian banks which offer this are
🔹Axis Bank- 0% for 3 months
🔹SBI - 0-1.7% for 6 months
🔹Standard chartered bank- 0.99% for 6 months
🔹Punjab National Bank- 0.99% for 6 months

Once you have exhausted this option you can convert your outstanding amount to a personal loan which has an interest rate of 14-16% which is far lesser than the 40% interest rate of credit cards. Please share this with someone who is in credit card debt and spread the word.

In May this year, a 76-year-old retired government employee of Bhubaneswar lost ₹5 lakh to a cybercriminal. The rising cases of cyber crimes in India may partly be attributed to the fact that almost all e-commerce companies store our credit card details to ensure faster check out. How do we solve this?

➡️ Enter Card Tokenisation.

Card tokenisation is a process where a unique code is generated for every combination of merchant, device and card. Meaning if you're purchasing on Amazon using your iPhone 11 and ICICI credit card, then there would a certain token generated for this combination. It is this token that Amazon would store in its servers. So even if Amazon gets hacked the token would be of no use to the hacker because he/she wouldn't know how to decrypt the token. Only card network companies like Visa, Mastercard and Rupay will be able to do it. This way the risk of leakage is significantly reduced.

Merchants have until Jan 2022 to implement this after which all the existing card details in their servers would be purged.

According to the RBI, real estate constitutes 77% of an average Indian's wealth. Thus, selling land is something most of us will do at least ones in our lifetime. Unfortunately, the only way to avoid paying taxes on real estate profits is to either buy another piece of land or invest in bonds issued by National Highways Authority of India or by Rural Electrification Corporation. On the latter, there is a lock in period of 5 years (earlier 3 years), abysmal interest rates of around 5% and maximum limit is ₹50 lacs. This is why the top 3 use cases of black money in India are: groceries, fuel and buying land.

What do you think is the solution for bringing crores of real estate money in the formal economy? Let me know in the comment section below.

336,Some ₹50 Lakhs Salary Itseems,"Has your commute time drastically reduced due to working from home? Or are you someone who owns 2 cars - one for regular travel and the other for special occasions?

Car insurance is usually given without considering the distance that will be covered by the car. So the insurance will cost the same regardless of whether you travel 5,000 km or 50,000 km. 

But there is an option called Pay As You Drive Car Insurance - which gives you discounts based on the distance slab you choose. 

The slabs are: 
- Below 3,000 kms
- 3,000 to 5,000 kms
- More than 5,000 kms

You can get upto 40% discount on your insurance if you choose the lowest distance option. 

This is ideal for someone who use cars only when there is no other option like Uber or public transportation. Or someone who owns 2-3 cars and doesn't all of them equally.

Currently I've seen ICICI provide this under an experimental program that was supposed to end last year but was extended due to COVID. 

➡️ Let me know if you've purchased this sort of a car insurance.

There are always indicators that will tell you if the market 📉is overvalued and if it’s the right time to start withdrawing your money especially for Small Cap Stocks which are highly sensitive to macro indicators.

The two main indicators ⚠️ when it comes to small cap funds are:

1️⃣ Ratio of Small Cap Index to the Nifty index - If the ratio exceeds 1.1 then you should initiate a systematic withdrawal plan. Right now its about 0.5 !

2️⃣ PE ratio of the Small Cap Index - If it crosses 80, then again you start a withdrawal plan. Currently it’s 36.

The current FD and Saving Account interest rates are hovering somewhere between 3 and 5%. Why did this happen? 2 years back the interest rate on FDs were around 6-7%. Why did the bank suddenly drop the interest rates? 🤨

Have you ever wondered what the bank 🏦 does with our savings account and fixed deposit? They give it out to other businesses at a higher interest rate. This is how the loan system works. Money is transferred from those who have more to those who have less at a cost. At the end of the day we are just a source of funds to the bank and they are the middlemen.

But what if the banks could get an alternate source of fund? Enter RBI 🇮🇳 Banks also have access to funds from RBI. Now if the RBI is ready to give out funds at lower interest rates aka repo rate, the banks are definitely going to prefer the RBI funds over retail depositors funds aka common man money. So it’s in the bank’s best interest to lower the interest rates for savings account and fixed deposits to make more money on the spread.

Now here is the kicker 🙌🏻 When the RBI eventually increases the interest rates, the banks are ideally supposed to increase the interest rates for retail depositors. But they take their own sweet time to do it and play the waiting game until they are obligated to do since the competition has done it. Until next time :)

One of the biggest challenges of Real Estate today is - Illiquidity. Meaning it’s difficult to sell a property 🏡 as and when you need it because of the legal technicalities and high ticket sizes.

Also, currently it’s not possible to free up a small portion of the capital tied up in real estate by selling only a part of your house 🏠 You would either need to sell your entire house else you get no money at all. This is exactly one of the problems blockchain is trying to solve. 💯 On the blockchain it is possible to tokenise your house into smaller units, say 1000 units and each of these units can be individually traded like a stock on the blockchain exchange by people like you and me aka Retail Investors. By this, you get to access some of the capital tied up in your house without vacating your home.

Currently 77% of an average Indian’s wealth is tied up in real estate. Real estate tokenisation can help free up a lot of this capital for varied purposes such as closing a loan, investing in other asset classes, funding a project etc.

The future applications of blockchain is exciting 🤩 and I wanted to share this with you through a fun skit. What other applications do you see for blockchain? Mention in the comments section below and let’s spread the good knowledge ⬇️

The two types of interest rates mentioned in this video are Reducing Balance Rate and Fixed Rate. Banks and NBFCs 🏦 usually don’t explicitly mention what kind of interest rate they are offering for the vehicle loans 🚘 in their marketing banners. They simply mention 10% interest.

Now if this 10% happens to be a Fixed Interest Rate then you could be misled into believing that it’s a cheaper loan compared to another bank’s 15% Reducing Balance Rate loan. Always be mindful of such deceitful marketing techniques by perusing the loan document and understanding exactly what kind of interest rate is being offered.

A Reducing Balance Rate is almost always better than a Fixed Rate because the interest rate in the former is calculated on a reducing outstanding loan amount. In simple terms - you pay a portion of the principal amount in every EMI. Hence the outstanding loan amount reduces every month and so does the interest payment every month. You don’t get this benefit in a fixed rate in which the interest is calculated on the initial principal amount throughout the tenure of the loan.

To put it in perspective of mathematical terms , a 5-year 10% fixed rate loan is equivalent to a 17% reducing rate loan.

Life Insurance coverage should be taken after considering the number of dependents 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 who are financially dependent on us over the course of our working life.

But life is uncertain and the circumstances change as we age. Marriage 👰‍♀️, children 👶🏻 etc. are major life stage events which have a significant impact on our finances.

A life insurance policy with a Life Stage Benefit enables us to change the coverage amount as we encounter major life stage events.

342,Selling My Car For ₹3 Lakhs,"Buying a brand new car 🚘 in my opinion is a stupid financial decision especially if you have begun your career and have no respectable savings. 

That’s why, the 2nd hand car market has skyrocketed in India in the past few years. But there are a couple of things you need to remember before you buy a 2nd hand car. 

🔹For the buyer: 
Make sure to transfer the insurance to your name within 14 days. The 3rd party insurance is automatically transferred and valid for 14 days. But own damage insurance isn’t. If you meet with an accident insurance company will not pay you jackshit.

🔹For the seller: 
The onus is on you to transfer the insurance. Otherwise if the new driver causes an accident, the insurance tribunal might order you to pay. 
Also, you will miss out on the NCB benefit if you don’t transfer. NCB is a discount for you new car insurance.

➡️ Bottom line: Do all the formalities properly before buying a 2nd hand car.

There are 3 things in life that you shouldn't be late for:
1- Attending your own wedding
2- US Visa appointment and....
3- Investing in ELSS

Most of us tend to put off ELSS investments until the last minute because 4 years of submitting engineering assignments until the last minute permanently affects our genes.

ELSS is a category of mutual fund which allows us to deduct our taxable income by up to 1.5 lakhs as per section 80C and hence can save us up to INR 50,000 in taxes every year.

Delaying ELSS investments can pose 3 major problems-
1) You might not have enough money to invest at the end of the year as opposed starting an SIP at the beginning of the year.
2) You might not get the units allocated to you if you invest on March 31st since it takes T+2 days for delivery
3) The NAV might be artificially higher because of herd investing during that time

➡️ Bottom line: Start tax planning on April 1st

86% of an average Indian's 🇮🇳 wealth is tied up in real estate. However a large majority of it is illiquid i.e. not easily convertible into cash. Also, real estate is prohibitively expensive 💰 for a vast majority of us especially in the commercial real estate space where average property value runs in hundreds of crores. This is unfortunate for retail investors since the rental yields in commercial properties are very lucrative usually 8-9% (3 times that of residential properties).

Enter Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) which are a relatively new asset class created to enable retails investors like us to invest in commercial properties 🏢 with as little as INR 50,000.

So essentially what happens is that thousands of investors like you and me can pool in our money 💵 to purchase commercial properties 🏢 like office spaces in multiple locations throughout India such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, Delhi etc. Essentially its like a mutual fund for real estate. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of the rental income on a quarterly basis. Thus it becomes an ideal investment for senior citizens 👴🏻 who are looking to have a regular source of income from their investments. In addition to dividends, REITs also benefit from appreciation in the value of the office properties.

REITs are traded on public stock exchanges and hence can easily be bought and sold thereby giving instant liquidity to investors. Only 3 REITs currently exist in India – Embassy Office Parks REIT, Mindspace Business Parks REIT and Brookfield REIT. 💯

Taxation: Dividends are completely tax free in the hands of the investor. Capital gains above 1 lakh is taxable at 10% after 3 years. If sold before 3 years, gains are taxed at 15%.

Interest Rate Parity concept states that the interest rates in different countries cannot be compared on an apple to apple basis.

Let’s take an example to understand this better. Let’s say you take a $100k loan at a 10% interest rate from both a US 🇺🇸 & an Indian 🇮🇳 bank. This is roughly around 80 lakhs (assuming $1 = ₹80). Let’s assume that the repayment period is 3 years. In those 3 years the rupee would have depreciated against the dollar to an average of ₹86 (₹80 to ₹92). Also the loan amount accumulated including interest would be $132k or ₹1.05 Cr. Now when you repay the US bank you have to repay the entire $132k. But when you repay the Indian bank you have to repay ₹1.05 Crs / ₹86 = $122k. See the magic? You save $8,000 which is about 6.4 lakhs. If you consider a longer repayment period, the savings are even more.

So that’s why a 10% interest rate US loan is not equal to a 10% interest Indian loan. It’s actually equivalent to a 15% interest rate Indian loan. Opt for a US loan only if the difference in interest is greater than 5%.

So effectively you would be able to save a lot of money if you opt for the Indian bank loan at 10% interest rate as opposed to US bank with 8% interest rate even though it looks smaller on paper.

From an investment perspective, purchasing physical gold jewellery 👑 is the worst way to go because you lose 12% of its value as soon as you walk out of the store due to ‘making charges’.

The best option is Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB) issued by RBI 🇮🇳 We can purchase up to 4kg of gold bonds per year. They are issued in denomination of 1 gram and hence are affordable to most middle class investors. Gold appreciates at 6-7% every year. SGB also give 2.5% interest rate on top of this. This the effective returns turns out to be 9-10%.

The tax treat of SGBs are very investor friendly. The capital gains tax (i.e. tax on the normal 6-7% appreciation of gold) is completely tax free is held until maturity of 8 years. The 2.5% interest rate is disbursed semiannually and is taxable as per income slab. The post tax returns overall is still lucrative enough to make it an essential requirement of our portfolio.

347,Elon Musk Is Giving BT,"I need ₹10,000 Crores to start Air Hegde airlines company. 

Obviously I don’t have that kind of money in my bank account. I tell the seller to give me the aeroplanes now and collect money from me 3 months later. In those 3 months I would secure some loans and also get some money from flying passengers with it. 

But the seller doesn’t trust me. But you do!!

So he’ll take my written contract and give it to you. You agree to give the seller ₹9,000 Crores upfront and collect the ₹10,000 Crores from me. Thereby you make ₹1000 Crore profit. 

➡️ This is called Invoice Discounting. 

You can 12-13% returns with this investment method. This can be a part of your alternate investment portfolio which usually should be 10-15% of your net worth. There are several companies in India which allow you to do this.

348,How Many Wives Will I Have?,"I wish I was immortal or at the very least live for 150 years. 

But I don't think science will be ready for that in our lifetimes. To make matters worse, I could even die at the age of 35 or 45 because of my unhealthy lifestyle, cancer or because of a freak accident like Final Destination. 

The point I'm trying to make is you never know when you're going to die. We all like to be optimistic and don't like to think about these sorts of grim topics (I can hear my mother saying ""Shaantam Paapam"" as I type this) but the fact is life is unpredictable and you are stupid if you don't prepare for the worst.

But you might tell me, ""Sharan, I don't have any wife or kids. My parents are well off and don't depend on me financially. Why bother?"" 

BUT eventually, you will have a wife (wives) and kids. If you wait to purchase the life insurance that late, the premiums will be very high. Imagine you have some heart problem or high BP because your kids eat your head all day - maybe one kid is a loser at school and another one is going through teenage pregnancy. With these health problems, your premiums are going to shoot up. But if you had bought it at the age of 25 it would have been super low and locked in until you're 60.

You can take a low cover now and opt for increasing cover or life stage benefit. With these options, you can customise your cover amount as you grow older. You wouldn't have to do the medical checks again even if you're an unhealthy chain smoker by then.

➡️ Bottom line: Don't wait to get married or have kids to get your life insurance.

349,We Save Billions Of Dollars In Taxes,"I made 2 job switches over a 4 year period. I started with a 4 lakh CTC at KPMG. Jumping twice allowed me to triple my salary to 12 Lakhs at PwC. 

Whoever tells you not to make career jumps doesn't have your best interest at heart or is an HR. This is the fastest way to grow your income. But of course, as with everything in life, don't overdo it.

Now coming to the tax implications of switching jobs. 

If you do it before 5 years of continuous service at a particular company, the EPF balance becomes taxable. 

What is EPF you ask? 

It's one of the main reasons why your salary is lesser than your CTC. It's the monthly 12% contribution you make to ensure that you have some money left over when you retire especially if you're a party animal. The best part is that these contributions are tax-free.

However, every time you switch a job a new EPF account is created. Now the government's tech is unfortunately not advanced enough yet to account for this jump in career (A tech change is coming soon to solve this). For the time being we need to manually transfer the balance from the old account to the new EPF account to avoid taxation.

➡️ Bottom line: After you give the treat to your friends for your new job make sure to transfer the EPF balance. You don't have to treat me. Just share it with all your friends and help them save money 🤗

350,I Got ₹50 Lakhs Bonus,"Have you blown off your bonus already? 💴 

A bonus is essentially a sudden inflow of money for a year's worth of hard work. Unfortunately, we are unable to attach the year's worth of effort to the bonus amount that we receive. 

What do I mean by that?

For example - Let’s say you make INR 50,000 per month. Let's say you receive INR 2 Lakhs in bonus. Now this bonus is for 12 months of hard work. But when we receive it in April it feels like free money because we forgot how hard we worked for it. That's why bonus is spent easily compared to monthly salary.

If you so have some left over, there is another problem. 

How do we invest this? 

You could invest all of it in the stock market at one go but in the current situation when markets are volatile that might be risky. It's better to do an SIP and average your entry. But where will the money sit while you're doing the SIP? Most of you will say savings account. 

There are 2 problems here:
1) Savings account give shit returns
2) Your propensity to spend that money is higher due to ease of access. Economics 101- Supply of money creates demand

➡️ This is what I recommend: Start a Systematic Transfer Plan (STP)

Park all the bonus in a low maturity Debt Fund and systematically transfer money from the debt fund to the equity mutual fund of your choice. Debt funds have better post-tax returns and are also less easy to spend compared to savings account.

TLDR: Psychology of spending bonus is different from regular salary. We treat it like free money. Start an STP to invest the bonus the most optimal and risk free way. 

➡️ What did you buy with your bonus? Be honest and comment down below :) I will tell you if it was worth it.

351,What Will Happen To My Kids?,"Dr. Strange probably wouldn’t have happened if he had taken a ➡️ Disability Rider. 

Most of us don’t like thinking that something terrible could happen to us but terrible things happen to innocent people everyday. 

The bare minimum is to have a Health and Life Insurance. But that’s still not enough. 

Imagine this - You’re on your way to office minding your own business. All of a sudden a rogue 2 wheeler crashes into you (it’s not uncommon for 2 wheelers to ride on the footpath in India). Next thing you know, you wake up in the hospital paralysed from the waist down. Your right arm is unable to move its fingers. 

Your health insurance takes care of the hospital bills. But your life insurance is useless coz you’re still alive. You can’t go to work anymore. How will you pay the bills?

Answer: Disability Rider !!

This rider will be a life saver in the above situation as it immediately gives you perhaps 50% of your life insurance cover if you’re disabled. Let’s say you get 50L lumpsum. Not bad right?

352,My Wife Said No To Amsterdam,"I usually like to plan my own trips because I love the planning process rather than following cookie cutter travel packager. 

But last year, I was super busy with work while planning my Goa trip 🌴 so I took the help of a well-renowned travel planner with huge social media presence. What could go wrong right?

Well, I was scammed big time. These were my requests:
(i)  3-day designated driver 🚘 
(ii) 5-star hotels 🏨 
(iii) Visit the 3 Kings chapel- it's apparently haunted 👻 

I was offered a great price and I took it. 1 day before the travel they tell me that one of the 5 star hotels would be changed to 3 star due to non-availability. Since I had already paid 50% I complied. Next, after arriving in Goa, I was only offered cab pick up and drop and not 24/7 like I had requested. Finally, I was not taken to the 3 Kings Chapel citing it was too far. 🙃

I swore never to use travel agents again no matter how busy I am. 

Turns out, these a-holes are using the Low Ball Technique, where they sucker you in with an attractive offer. Once they get their foot in the door it's easy for them to make additional requests and take you in for a ride. We are more likely to comply once we agree to the first offer.

353,I Got Scammed,"Next time you go to the bank, I want you to eavesdrop 👂 on the conversation between the bank official and an innocent senior citizen. Chances are it's mostly likely related to purchasing an insurance instead of a FD promising better returns. 

The unassuming senior citizen agrees to do it and invests 2L of his hard-earned money. Next year he gets a notice saying that his insurance has lapsed. 

Why? 

Coz he was supposed to invest 2L every year to keep the insurance active else the invested money is also gone. 

Most likely, this would have been hidden from him. Even if he had invested 2L every year, these money-back insurance policies give barely 3-4% returns (far cry from senior citizen FD- 7%). The bank agent is able to sell it by using absolute numbers instead of mentioning % returns. 

If you've read my last week's newsletter I teach you how to calculate these numbers.

What is the solution?

Well firstly, it's a good idea to record your conversation with insurance sellers. Next, keep a copy of the brochure that they are using to sell insurance to you. Sometimes they use fudged numbers to make their point. Finally, keep a copy of the proposal document to ensure that they haven't sold you the wrong product.

If you've been scammed first approach the insurer and submit all the proofs. If they take more than 30 days, go to the insurance ombudsman. There are 17 in the country. They will resolve the issue for free within 3 months. If that doesn't work out you can finally go to the consumer court.

354,My Mom Made Chicken Ghee Roast For Lunch,"My bank (ICICI) is asking me to maintain INR 50,000 minimum balance for a newly opened bank account. 🤨

It was INR 10,000 only a few years back. I agreed to it  because it was required on urgent basis. 

Why is this a problem? 

Well, banks charge us a penalty for not maintaining this balance and sometimes it becomes very difficult to maintain it especially when there are big purchases like AC, TV, flight tickets etc. Banks made INR 10,000 Crore in these charges over the last 3 years. 🙃

How to avoid this?

Create a Family Savings Account. 🤙🏻

Basically up to 4-5 family members can group their individual accounts under 1 bucket. The accounts can be operated separately like a normal account but the minimum balance will calculated on a overall basis. So if you're unable to maintain the balance this month your dad may have surplus and vice versa. 💯 That way the chances of paying the penalty becomes lower. 

Penalties can be as high as INR 750 per month. So basically a PVR gold ticket. 🤯

They also come with other perks depending on the bank:
1) 50% off on locker rental
2) Free international debit card
3) Free cash withdrawals at any bank ATM
4) Door step banking services
5) Wealth management services

356,I Took A Pill In Ibiza,"Once you’ve retired you need to be extra careful with how you’re investing your money. This is assuming that you’ve been able to save your FIRE number by then. This is because you don’t have an income source any more. You need to live off your savings. If you have significantly more money than the FIRE number then you don’t have to worry too much. One of the perks of being rich 🤑 

But for the rest of us, this is what you should do. 

Sequence Of Returns Risk is a BIG deal during retirement. Meaning you can get 10% CAGR returns by having 
(1) 30%, 20%, 10%, -10%, -20%, -30% over a period of 6 years  OR
(2) -30%, -20%, -10%, 10%, 20%, 30% over a period of 6 years

However, the latter can be disastrous if it happens during retirement because during retirement you’re also withdrawing from the savings. So if you withdraw during the down years (bear market) you won’t be able to recover when the market recovers. This is called sequence of returns risk. 

To avoid this you need to follow the bucketing strategy or the equity glide method. Let’s explain the bucketing strategy today.

It basically means invest upto 7-8 years of expenses in safe instruments like debt and gold and the remaining in equity. If the market crashes don’t touch the equity and only spend from debt. It usually takes a decade for even the worst bear markets to recover. 

Shortly I will cover equity glide method. Until then you have to follow my man Finance With Sharan and help your parents do this if they haven’t already.

But there's one call you shouldn't avoid 🙏🏻

➡️ RENEWAL of your car insurance 🚘 

Here's what can happen if you forget to renew your car insurance on time:
1) A new round of inspection will be done which would lead to higher premiums or rejection. 
2) It is illegal to drive around without at least third party cover. 

If you delay by more than 90 days then you lose the No Claim Bonus benefit (NCB). It's a discount which an insurance company gives you for not making any claims and it can rise as high as 50% discount. 😱 If you forget to renew, you will lose out on this discount.

➡️ Bottom line: Don't shout at the insurance company reps when they call you. Listen to them for atleast 10 seconds before giving them the finger.

For this you can create equally funded individual accounts called ""fun money"" !!

363,Don’t Go Behind Girls,"Having a kid is really expensive. Might as well use them to save taxes. 🤪

As per the law, you are allowed to open FDs in your major child's name to avoid paying hefty taxes of up to 30% on your interest. Profit up to INR 2.5 lakhs in a year is completely tax free saving you about INR 75,000 if you fall in the 30% income bracket. 

You can also invest in equity instruments in their name and take advantage of the 1 lakh tax exemption again. 

➡️ Bottom line: Don't let your child go to waste. Use them to save taxes. 😎

It is essentially a fund which closely matches the Sensex or the Nifty and hence the returns will be similar to what Indian stock market delivers. Also, they have very low expense ratio, usually 1/10th the cost of direct equity mutual funds. Kotak has recently filed papers to launch the Nifty 50 Alpha fund which is a low cost index fund which would follow the strategy explained in the reel. It is sort of like a quasi momentum fund and will be the first of its kind. It’s 5 year returns is far superior to that of the Nifty 50.",2021-07-05,55628,2823,31,xq7V8_AQxqE
